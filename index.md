# A Seed, Once Sown

By Rhia Ro

## Witness the Dawn

Elanqo was in the thicket of the Old Ones when the news came across the overstory that Saba was almost home. Finally!

'Almost' still meant days away, or more; enough time to get ready for Saba's Germination. As long as the preparations were begun at once!

Elanqo scrambled to pull themself back into the herenow. It took a few moments to untangle their mind from the synctium and their legs from the undergrowth as they found their feet. Everyone always said - well, those past Germination at any rate - that a rapid departure from the deep network of the synctium was a bad idea, going to do some damage even, but Elanqo did it all the time. People also claimed that simultaneous connections with the deep net and the high net were next to impossible to maintain, but Elanqo found themself passively monitoring the overstory almost without trying, regardless of what else they were doing. Even more so in the seasons that Saba had been away.

Elanqo composed themself enough to bid a respectful farewell to the silent Old Ones, then raced down the hill towards the vineway, and back to the main den.

They found their two best sibfriends huddled together outside the circular entrance to the big meeting space in the central trunk of the den. Dimiti and Bianqo were both younger and bigger than Elanqo and they looked up as once when Elanqo approached.

Dimiti beamed, a face of sunshine. "You heard!" The springy vines that adorned Dimiti's entire body were in full flower, trumpets in reds, whites and oranges, bobbing enthusiastically with the slightest movement, and they were perpetually surrounded by a humming cloud of tiny insects.

"What's going on?"

"The Germinated are with Ipti-Ominno-Emiana making their plans inside. They told us to keep out of the way."

Bianqo, lanky, six-limbed, skin gnarled and woody, emitted a sensation of excited apprehension.

"Something's wrong?" Elanqo had a funny feeling. "We should be helping. Wait there."

Elanqo launched themself at the deeply ridged side of the central trunk and climbed swiftly to the curved top, and then along to an opening. They slowed down as they approached, treading lightly, and pressed an ear to the bark as close as they could manage without revealing any part of their head to anyone inside who might chance to look up. Elanqo was expert at this particular maneuver.

They could tell at once that the Germinated inside were using the overstory to talk to someone further away; probably the first outpost at the edge of the desert. They were saying little that was meaningful out loud. Elanqo's patience trickled away to nothing.

"What's happening?" They stuck their head through the hole in the ceiling, both unthinking and uncaring about giving away their eavesdropping spot. "When is Saba coming?"

None of the Germinated looked remotely surprised at the intrusion. Palemilia-Kimini, who was the most recently returned from their own germination journey the previous hot season, beckoned Elanqo with a pale sinuous finger. Elanqo crumpled themself up small, bending joints and flexing limbs in ways that many people could not, and popped their whole body through the skylight, landing deftly in a crouch at the edge of the circle of seated figures.

Palemilia-Kimini leaned their gaunt, spectral face towards Elanqo and spoke in a hushed voice. "Saba has been away for almost four seasons," which was more than twice as long as most peoples' germination journeys, Elanqo knew. "So a few people are checking if... there's anything we should be aware of."

"Didn't you and Saba leave at the same time?" Asked Elanqo, at a normal volume. "Saba must have had more to discover. I'm excited to hear about it. What name do you think they'll pick?" Elanqo was quite sure that when their own turn came around - and _surely_ that would be after the upcoming monsoon - they'd discover their Germinated name would be Saba. Or the same as Saba's. Or something.

"Saba left a little before me, actually. But went to the desert, and I went to the sea. You're right, I'm sure Saba has discovered much."

Palemilia-Kimini stood up, which looked a lot like an invisible puppeteer slowly unfolding a complex paper model. They were over twice as tall as Elanqo. The others in the circle followed suit.

"We have three days to prepare," said the elderly Ipti-Ominno-Emiana with a kind smile in Elanqo's direction. "Saba is travelling below ground until the farthest reach of the vineway, which will bring them the rest of the way home to us. All is well."

Elanqo wondered why this needed to be said. Of course all was well! Saba was returning! Three days!

"Little El'o," said Ipti-Ominno-Emiana. "Please could you, and your sibfriends outside of course, plan the food we need for the celebration? Start with a list of all the things you know Saba likes best."

Elanqo bristled at the nickname, but overlooked it at once. "I know, I know," they said, setting off at once for the door to update Dimiti and Bianqo. "Easy, no problem."

There was a sadness in Ipti-Ominno-Emiana's eyes as they watched their young ward depart through the side entrance of the trunk.

------

Technically Elanqo could go for a whole season without actively drinking anything. Well, not hot season yet, but they would when they were bigger. (If they ever got bigger! If only they grew as fast as Bianqo! Visibly taller every day!) But damp season was easy, and monsoon of course. Actually it was even supposed to be bad for them if they drank too much, but they hadn't found out how much was too much yet. Maybe they should try, just to be sure, and to see what would happen exactly. It was useful to know know these things. To know one's limitations, Saba would say. They'd talk about this with Saba when they got back. There was so much to discuss with Saba.

Dimiti and Bianqo were arguing about Saba's favourite beverage.

It didn't matter, of course, because they could have both options at the celebration. But watching an argument between one who was vocal and vibrant and high energy, and one who loomed and creaked and didn't speak a single word aloud was always a source of great fascination to Elanqo. With a wry smile they hoped, not for the first time, that their sibfriends would never change.

The trio were bathed in the golden light of the setting sun. They came up here often, to the highest den they were permitted, for the view at dusk. The sky was an ever-deepening purple, streaked with grey smears of half-hearted clouds, and the jungle canopy stretched out all around them, glittering like a carpet of jewels.

The air was humid; typically so for this season. The succulent fronds that covered Elanqo's head, hanging down a little past their shoulders, were bulging healthily. Their genetic gifts, they were sure, meant that it was right and proper that they would follow Saba's route into the desert. They were _made_ for the desert. Their skin and fronds were even the same soft peachy shade as the sands which stretched on and on to foothills of the far southern mountain ranges.

The final rays of sunlight dwindled and disappeared. Dimiti and Bianqo stopped arguing and turned to watch Farne rise above the horizon. Elanqo felt a surge of longing from Bianqo for the distant glowing disc. That was new.

"Will you go there?" Asked Dimiti. "When it's your turn?"

Elanqo shuddered and turned away, pretending to be preoccupied with a pattern of leaves on the decking by their feet. Farne was so far away. They wouldn't even be able to communicate via the overstory. Going to the desert was one thing but journeys between Nemata and Farne took far longer than a few seasons. It was too long for a germination journey, but when Bianqo was Germinated there would be nothing to stop them from voyaging to the sibling community in orbit, if that's what they needed to do.

"Let's check over the plan for tomorrow," Elanqo changed the subject. "Dimiti, your first task is?"

"Redberries from the bushes on the seaward side of the thicket of the Old Ones," they said at once. "To make Saba's _favourite_ fruit presse. I need to deliver them to Membe-Horala before first quarter."

"Perfect. Bianqo?"

Bianqo emoted and mimed: a dip in the synctium to retrieve the knowledge of how to prepare a sweet delicacy associated traditionally with the constellations that were overhead when Saba was sown. None of the three had ever eaten it, it was a truly archaic recipe, but Ipti-Ominno-Emiana had agreed that this was a worthwhile occasion for all to rediscover it.

"Great. And I'll spend first half crushing oacanout leaves, or at least I can find someone else to take over. Because we're going to need so much of that."

Bianqo gestured a timberous arm and recoiled with disgust. They couldn't stand the pungent smell of oacanout, and so certainly would not be helping with that task. The smell disappeared once it was flash fermented, of course.

"I know I know," said Elanqo. "Once you have your special recipe you can track down all the ingredients for it. I hope it's all things we still have around. How long has it been since someone made that here?"

"Membe-Horala said they'd had it," said Dimiti.

"Hmm," said Elanqo. "Membe-Horala is nearing flowering. So that's a pretty long time."

"We should go down," said Dimiti. "It's dark. I'm running low."

Dimiti's body chemistry depended heavily on the sunlight. They ran out of energy quickly, and usually couldn't do anything at night. The flowers covering their body already hung limp, petals closed.

"I don't know why you can't get a 'duction to sort that out," muttered Elanqo, heading for the lift shaft. "You could, you know, if you really pushed for it."

"It wouldn't be right," replied Dimiti wearily. "Not until after germination. Then I'll know if it's right."

Elanqo shrugged, and fingered their fronds. "I want a 'duction to make these bigger. Or more down my back. So I can go a whole season in the desert without needing anything. I'm going to keep asking."

They made their way to the shaft opening, Dimiti leaning on Bianqo and starting to drag their feet. Elanqo lightly tugged the woven cord to summon the lift and a sturdy open platform trundled into view from below, stopping level with the side of the deck on which they stood. All three of them sat, slumped against each other for the fast but steady descent.

Bianqo helped Dimiti along, back toward the main den, to a place of rest.

Elanqo went in a different direction, towards the moss caves. They felt their energy already dwindling and wanted to fully refuel so that there would be no distractions or interruptions for the next two and a half days of preparations. They could access the restorative properties of the brytosphere from anywhere of course, but there was a comfortable nook in the rocks at the end of the entrance to the moss caves that Saba had always preferred, and Elanqo had taken up that spot when Saba left.

Elanqo wondered what Bianqo was doing for the resto of the night. They had forgotten to ask. Probably going to find a clearing to stand in and bask in the light of the moon. Or maybe they'd get a head start on their search of the memories in the synctium. It was only a stortnight ahead of them, at any rate.

Elanqo's eyes saw as well in darkness as they did in daylight, and they traversed the thorn-strewn and narrow ridge path down to the cave with the ease of long familiarity. A soft buzzing and a kind of static presence permeated the air for some distance beyond every entrance to the enormous underground complex. Nobody but the Old Ones had experienced the true depths of the caves, though Elanqo was convinced they had felt the essence of it sometimes when they delved into the synctium.

Saba's nook (for it was still Saba's - Elanqo was just borrowing it temporarily) was a little way inside a steeply sloping entrance. The rock underfoot was moist and the walls slimy. Elanqo's skin prickled in anticipation of proximity to the energy reserves held by the lichens that densely covered every surface of the inner warren of the caves, just out of sight.

Elanqo hoisted themself into a rock formation that jutted out of the cave wall, as if a giant had punched it through from the other side. They had to squeeze through a narrow crack, but once inside they had space to shift around comfortably. There were small craggy openings in just the right places to have sight of anyone entering or leaving the caves, without those passers by knowing that Elanqo was there so long as they stayed still and quiet, and so long as that passer by was not particularly adept at sensing the presence of others.

Elanqo settled in. They skimmed the surface of the synctium for a brief comforting connection with all that came before, then linked up to the wide net of the brytosphere.

The contents of the moss caves were the link between the two. If there was anywhere Elanqo was going to manage to connect to all three of Nemata's networks at once, it would be here. But that was a challenge for another time.

People described connecting to the brytosphere in very different ways. For Elanqo, time was slowed down and they experienced a gentle, careful examination of every cell in their body. It was like a guided tour of the very essence of their being.

They sat very still and closed their eyes and waited for their heart rate to slow.

Then they opened them again. This time the landscape was a smooth green sea with not a ripple on the surface. Elanqo was walking across it, held up by the surface tension like an insect would be. Elanqo had seen this manifestation of the brytosphere before, but not since before Saba left. That might mean something.

The sky overhead was a kind of bright grey, like the sun burned high just behind a smooth and moodless layer of clouds. There was no sound at all, until a light hiss of air nearby. Elanqo turned to see a large white bird arcing away. This would be their guide. Elanqo followed.

As they walked, always in the direction of the bird, which was sometimes close and sometimes distant, always diving and wheeling around, tendrils of water snaked up their legs and probed at parts of their body.

One found a tightness in their left knee. The water pooled around the spot, bulging outwards and then soaking in, as if it had been suddenly sucked from inside. Elanqo felt their joint loosen and ease almost at once.

Another tendril wove its way between their head fronds, coolly relieving tensions they hadn't even been aware of a moment before.

They lifted their feet to walk in the usual manner, but the surface of the water rose with them, so they never lost contact with it. Elanqo experienced the enriching energy of the brytosphere entering their body as a thousand tiny prickles across the soles of their feet. They could follow each mote, each molecule as it travelled up their legs and through the internal network of their biology until it reached a place it was needed and was absorbed.

As usual, Elanqo tried to focus the energy into growth, into maturation. To hasten the day they'd be ready to germinate.

Elanqo walked ten thousand steps, growing stronger and more alert with each one. They scowled at the bird which still moved away in the distance, and hadn't stopped to circle an exit yet.

The plan wasn't really to grind leaves for half of the day tomorrow; they had a plan that would let them automate that. If it worked. Once thatw as in place, they could commandeer a group of keen little plumules and set them to making decorations. Then there was the music; Elanqo had to catch up with a few different people to work out the options. They were pretty confident that Dimiti and Bianqo could take care of the rest of the food and drinks by themselves, but they'd check on them periodically of course. They'd have to remind them to get the fermented ambiboes out of storage. And they couldn't go without Saba's favourite toasted rokanuts to garnish everything. And of course no germination feast would be complete without a hot season fruit jelly tower, and Elanqo was determined to make sure Saba's was going to be the biggest and most colourful and most extravagent anyone could remember. People would be talking about it for seasons to come. But most importantly, there was Elanqo's gift to Saba.

Elanqo glanced impatiently at the bird again. The brytosphere would keep them as long as it determined they needed it, but surely it must be time to return to the herenow. They looked down at their feet and started. They almost stopped walking, but long habit kicked in; to lose momentum in the brytosphere was to become perilously lost.

The surface of the water around their wide flat feet had changed from deep rich green to the same shade of peach as Elanqo's own skin. It was like Elanqo was melting, merging with the sea, or whatever part of the brytosphere this sea represented. The patch of colour was spreading out in all directions, following Elanqo to keep them at the center even as it grew. Elanqo clenched their fists, kept their heart steady, and kept walking, one foot in front of the other.

The bird was getting further away.

Had anything like this happened before? Not to them. A change in the manifestation of the brytosphere _while someone was linked in_; they were sure they would have remembered coming across a mention of something like that.

Elanqo tried to connect to the synctium but was immediately and sharply rebuffed.

The sensation of the sea underfoot was no longer slick and smooth, but coarse. Grainy. Like sand.

Suddenly it was the desert spreading out around them. The change had reached almost as far as Elanqo could see, the final vestiges of green water diminishing toward what passed for the horizon.

There was never a sharp line marking the horizon in the brytosphere. It always hinted at a distinction between ground (or sea) and sky, but it was hard to look directly at it, it blurred into a hazy gradient, and often appeared unnervingly higher or lower in one's perspective than it did in the herenow. It was best to keep the horizon in one's peripheries.

The surface was no longer completely flat, but gently rippled, wind-ruffled, arcing in small dunes that Elanqo had to mount and descend.

The bird guide was a faraway speck.

Elanqo tried various emergency exit strategies, to no avail. They even tried the patterns of thought that let them disconnect in haste from the synctium, but that _hurt_. A tendril of sand wound its way along Elanqo's spine and into the back of their neck to repair the damage.

_I'm not panicking_, thought Elanqo, and pinged the overstory. They could see the traffic. Normal levels of high net activity, but slowed down relative to brytosphere time. But it was like a picture, flat and impenetrable. Normally the overstory was a multidimensional space that Elanqo could zoom into and ride along at any point, but now they could only see it, not touch, as if it was behind a pane of glass.

They let go of the connection. For one instance they had switched focus completely away from the brytosphere and almost stopped their walk. They scanned the sky - still grey and featureless - frantically trying to relocate the bird.

A rush of cold air overhead, and a croak that was the loudest sound Elanqo had ever heard emitted from a guide in the brytosphere. The bird was directly overhead, close, circling.

Elanqo gripped their own shoulders in a tight hug, arms clenched across their chest, relief flooding them. They crouched, then jolted back upright in the herenow.

They scrambled to a squat and peered out of the nook. It was still dark. The panic and conflusion faded quickly. The calm but energised feeling that usually followed a connection with the brytosphere resurfaced, and Elanqo stretched their limbs in satisfaction.

_Weird glitch_, they thought, climbing back to the ground. _I wonder if anyone else felt it._

From the position of Farne in the sky, the night was about half way through when Elanqo stepped out of the moss caves. It wouldn't be long before the pale light of second dawn started to bleed across the world.

-------

Elanqo had a special place; so far they had shared it with no-one. It was in a dense part of the jungle, a little way away from the main den, towards the big river called the Harshness that carved the jungle in two. They had found the entrance by chance, about twelve days after Saba had left on their germination journey. Elanqo had spent most of their time alone for quite some time after Saba left. The discovery had turned out to be the perfect place to continue their isolation. That is, until The Voice awoke.

Elanqo nimbly traversed the undergrowth, twisting their limbs around tangled vines, slipping between the leaves of enormous ferns, deftly avoiding sinkholes, squeezing between moss-draped old branches.

They reached the narrow suspension bridge over the gorge that marked the boundary of the main den, and raced across. The bridge swung from side to side and the panels clattered underfoot. Elanqo giggled. When they were much smaller, Saba had been afraid to cross this bridge; many plumules were. Saba would shriek and cling to one of the end posts while Elanqo raced up and down, seeing just how much they could make it sway. Elanqo never understood Saba's fear. There was no reason to believe they would fall. Even when there was no reason to hurry, Elanqo would rush across. They loved the feeling of motion; the horizon moving out of the corner of their eye; glimpses of the hundred foot drop to the colourful flower-filled canopy below. This must be what it's like to fly.

On the other side of the bridge, Elanqo went more carefully. HIdden amongst the dense undergrowth here were tiny golden paradise flowers, whose shimmering petals concealed a single hooked claw. This latched easily onto skin and clothes, ripping the head off the flower and leaking a slowly working soporific toxin into its unwitting conveyance. It numbed the area it pierced, too, so you could have a lot of the venom in your bloodstream by the time you realised it had got you. And if you fell asleep before you managed to get to the brytosphere, you had better hope somebody knew where you'd gone.

The ferns and palms and brambles gradually disappeared, replaced more and more by taller, wider trees with solid thick trunks. They were adorned with climbing plants whose aerial roots reached out and curled around branches, striving ever higher towards the gaps in the canopy.

Before long the trees became so huge that Elanqo had had to work out the fastest route between them and avoid wrong turns or detours lest they end up doubling the distance to skirt a mile-round trunk.

Beyond this, the trees became so huge that Elanqo was simply walking under the roots. They arched overhead forming enormous buttresses. Even in daytime, no light penetrated here.

The hideaway entrance was beneath one such gargantuan growth. It was almost as if the tree had sprung from it, whatever the construct had been, some thousands of years ago.

At first, Elanqo had thought they had found a new entrance to the moss caves. But the walls to this tunnel were not rocky and damp. Once past the mounds of decaying leaves and rotting branches and clumps upon clumps of grey fruiting fungi, the walls to the tunnel widened and smoothed out, becoming more like a corridor, something constructed. They were made of a material Elanqo had never felt anywhere else, cold and evenly ridged. The ground sloped gently downwards, and, beneath the silt that had drifted in from outside, was the same even texture as the walls. The walls met the floor at perfect right angles; nothing in the jungle or the main den did this. The ceiling curved overhead in a distinctively smooth arc.

Elanqo had spent days exploring and mapping the place out when they had first found it, but by now they knew exactly where they were going.

There were three doors at the end of the corridor. One in the final wall, where the route came to an abrupt end, and one in the walls each side facing one another. Elanqo took the left most one. it wasn't a door on hinge or a curtain of beads like most of those in the dens. There was a narrow crack down the center, which widened just enough when Elanqo forced it for them to squeeze through, then snapped back when they let it go from the other side.

This room was where Elanqo was creating their gift for Saba.

"Welcome back Elanqo," said the Voice. "How have you been?"

"Saba is nearly back," Elanqo strode quickly to the wide rectangular table in the middle of the room. "So I have to ifnish this! And all of the other things to help with the germination celebration."

"How wonderful," the Voice responded in its usual gentle monotone, though Elanqo chose to read enthusiasm and excitement into it. "And perfect timing, since you are almost finished."

The table was covered in square trays, each about the size of Elanqo's palm. Elanqo had found them all in the hideaway; all were transparent, with finger-high lips around each edge so nothing could spill over. In each tray they had been carefully nurturing different slim moulds, experimenting with 'duction, the brytosphere, and outside agents, until each one resembled a little part of the world. Elanqo had arranged them over the table in a giant mosaic to form a living map of Nemata.

Only the tray that was supposed to depict the Great Northern Falls was failing them right now.

"Maybe I should just fill it with water," Elanqo plucked the tray from its place and carried it carefully over to a cluttered work bench. The substance inside it was droopy and yellow. "And give up on this one. I'm out of ideas."

"Perhaps it needs light," suggested the Voice, as always.

"Things don't need _light_," grumbled Elanqo, fishing around the equipment on the bench for a clean pipette. "They need the energy they can make from light. They get the energy directly from the brytosphere. So they can skip the light."

"Perhaps, then, it _wants_ light."

"Hmmph." Elanqo was doubtful of the Voice's theory that slime moulds could _want_ anything. Besides, they had got every other variety to cooperate, eventually.

Elanqo lifted a sample from the edge of the tray, where the mould was lifeless and liquid. They dropped it into an anlysis buble and waited for the output. This came in the form of colour and scent.

"Well, it's not dead," Elanqo surmised. "It seems to just _want_ to be like this. It doesn't make sense."

"Perhaps you should try a different variety."

"I think I'm going to have to. I was so sure this was just a nudge away. But it's just getting worse. I'm going to have to make a lot of change to one of the others to get what I want. Hmm."

"Maybe Saba can help you when they get back."

"Silly, this needs to be ready _before_ Saba is back. What kind of gift would that be?"

"A puzzle. Saba  likes a puzzle, you told me. A project for you both to do together, like the old days."

Elanqo didn't say anything. They weren't sure that Saba would have time for their 'projects' once they were Germinated. Until Elanqo returned from their own germination journey, they would be a bit apart. The Voice had already known about Germination and so on when Elanqo had met it, but it didn't seem to understand why Elanqo was so keen to reach that milestone themselves.

Over the past few seasons, Elanqo had borrowed a steady stream of supplies from the bodyworks. There was a lot of equipment already in the hideaway, but it was completely alien. Elanqo couldn't fathom the purpose of a vast majority of it. The Voice wasn't any help, speaking in riddles or using nonsense words whenever Elanqo asked about it.

"Okay, focus," Elanqo muttered to themself. "Try three more. Ilyavid, with genes from peaknid, that should get it growing up and out, give it a kind of pouring thing going on. The semaphid could go in with it if I can get it to go white so it looks like foam. There's a bacteria that will do that..." Elanqo slipped into the synctium for a moment to find out which one. "Hmm, and I could maybe train a ramapid into a kind of swirl. That wouldn'te xxactly look like the Falls, but-"

"It's good abstract imagery."

"Uh huh. Only I need to stop it from glowing."

"Won't you display this for Saba in the daylight? Surely it doesn't matter if it glows in the dark."

"It doesn't glow in the dark. It really _glows_. It would really stand out. I think I can inject something to block that thought." Back to the synctium.

Elanqo prepared the three trays as quickly as they could, feeding them from the brytosphere and giving them all engineered additives that would speed up their progress.

A part of them toyed with the idea of taking some of that themself. But they were pretty sure it wouldn't work how they expected. yet. They had learnt a lot from the slim moulds these past seasons. Maybe it would be time to work on people soon.

"I'd better get back," they said, washing their hands under icy cold water that came from a pipe in the corner of the room. They had painstakingly repaired this system, with help from the Voice, not long after they had found the place. It worked completely differently from the plumbing in the dens, though Elanqo wasn't sure they could explain the workings of either of them on the spot.

On the way out, Elanqo raided the various drawers and boxes and loaded several strange but useful - they were sure - devices into the large baggy pocket on the front of their tunic.

-----

"Where have you been?" Dimiti came rushing out of a mound house as Elanqo walked by. "We've been looking for you everywhere."

It was almost half way through first quarter when Elanqo got back to the main den. They waved Dimiti's question away. "How's it going?"

"Bianqo found the recipe, but guess what it contains."

"What?"

"Mzemelnee."

Elanqo groaned. There had been some kind of blight and no-one had seen any of the floral purple berries growing for at least the past three hot seasons.

"Maybe we can substitute it with something?" Suggested Dimiti.

"Well, you know who has a whole barrell of dried mzemelnee, don't you?"

"Um.."

"Melia-Adonde-Samamba."

"Oh no. Well, there's just no way they'd talk to us. And even if they would do you think a germination feast is even a good enough reason to share? It's medicinal. I think it's really for emergencies, you know?"

"Let's think, there must be a way around this," insisted Elanqo. "We have to try. Who _would_ they talk to?"

"Maybe if Ipti-Ominno-Emiana went directly?"

"No way, Ipti-Ominno-Emiana asked us to take care of this. We can't ask for help at the first thing."

"I think they'd probably say asking for help is-"

"We are getting help, just not from them." Elanqo thought for another moment. Nobody owed them a favour. Who might be happy to have Elanqo on the hook for something? One of Saba's older sibfriends, most likely. "I'll go to Eliya-Amna," they decided. "Can you try a few other berries and see if any of them will do as a substitution in the meantime? I know mzemelnee is pretty distinctive, but since less than half the den probably have even eaten it in a dessert maybe we can take some liberties." Some people treated the traditional celestial recipes as sacred and unchangeable. Elanqo had no such reservations, but they had a feeling Eliya-Amna might.

"I saw joosberries and tumma beans in the berry patch earlier. Maybe a combination... But look, I don't think Bianqo thinks we should substitute."

Elanqo nodded. "I'll ping Bianqo, they can come with me to the hives."

First, Elanqo made a stop at the machine shed on the outskirts of the main den. Seasons before, they and Saba had developed a fleeting fascination with gears and turnshifts and pulleys that could add strength and speed to many laborious tasks. Most plumules went through that phase, before Germination clarified the roles they were to play and they had the 'ductions needed to optimise their own bodies for it. But Elanqo already knew their role was not going to be related to pummeling oacanout leaves into grit, and had no qualms about seeking an efficient solution.

Derria-Esto greeted Elanqo with a warm smile and a brief hug. They were not much taller than a plumule, light on their feet, with fast twitchy movements like an insect. They also had two extra pairs of arms, with four different specialised hands which were always busy with something in the background.

"What can I do for you this fine quarter?"

"Well you've probably heard that Saba's germination will be soon-"

"Of course, of course! I remember your little sibfriend. Very smart, that one."

"Yes, right. You had this thing with a handle, with rocks inside that rise and fall when you turn it..."

"Ah, the pulveriser. Yes, I still have some of them, but-"

"Will it work on oacanout leaves? To crust them for fermentation?"

"It certainly would, except that-"

"How many do you have?"

"There are six, but they're in various states of-"

"Can I borrow all of them? Is it okay to take them to Rianer Corner, or is it better if I bring the oacanout leaves up here?"

"I love your enthusiasm little E'lo, but none of the pulverisers are entirely in working order right now!"

"What do you need to fix them?" Asked Elanqo without missing a beat. "Do you have time now?"

Derria-Esto sighed indulgently. "For you, and for Saba, I have time this quarter. Let's see, come with me."

Elanqo helped Derria-Esto take the components down from packed and cluttered storage hammocks. Everything appeared to be suspended haphazardly in the cavernous structure of the machine shed, but Derria-Esto clearly knew exactly where everything was. They weren't even checking in with the synctium. _I want that kind of cataloguing memory,_ thought Elanqo, as they watched Derria-Esto flitting around.

In the end it didn't really take long to fix up four of the six machines into working order. One was a complete write-off. A crucial cable had degraded so much that the whole thing would need to be disassembled to replace it.

"This one needs new bearings here and here," Derria-Esto pointed. "And those will need them soon. If you're planning to use them all quarter we had better replace them now or they'll surely break down.

"Okay," said Elanqo. "How do we fix it?" They did a quick mental calculation. They'd really need to have made a good start on crushing leaves by half way through second quarter if they stood any chance of getting the fermentation started in time. Derria-Esto turned to a small contraption suspended nearby, opened a hatch, and extracted some parts with a click.

"We need perfectly smooth round stones about this size." Elanqo took the pair and rolled them around in their palm. They certainly were perfectly smooth and round. They could detect the evenness of the weight. "We can polish it up a bit of course, but the closer we can get to that to start with, the quicker it'll be to get all of the machines working."

"What's that machine for?" Elanqo pointed at the thing from which the ball bearings had come.

"It's a water sprinkler, for helping in the hot season when things get a bit dry."

"Well, it's not hot season now."

"That's right..."

"So if we borrow this, I only need to find eight more. And I can get one of the machines going right away. Sound okay?"

"Oh. Uh, I guess so. Sure. Smart."

"Got any more?"

"Not... that aren't in use at the moment."

"Not even any that I could just borrow when the machines are having a break?"

"I don't think so," Derria-Esto shook their head, feeling like Elanqo might be outwitting them somehow. But then they often got that impression from the plumules. "I'll think about it. But I don't think there are any."

"Okay. I'll bring the one machine up to where the leaves are, and be back for the rest when I've got the parts."

Derria-Esto watched Elanqo load the parts into a small barrow and trundle it back up the hill. "Just make sure you get those extra ball bearings for me for the sprinkler after Saba's feast is over!" They turned to go back inside and then realised something. "Wait, how will you grind the leaves if you're off looking for-" But Elanqo was gone.

-----

Elanqo set the machine up on Rainer Corner. There was a small decorative fountain there which bubbled with water pumped up from the nearby underground reservoir. Elanqo briefly contemplated the various mechanisms that powered the thing, but decided they were not desperate enough to start pillaging it for parts quite yet. Besides, it had its own role to pay in Elanqo's scheme to automate the grinding machines.

Rainer Corner was an out of the way spot in the main den. Not a high traffic area, but people often cut through that way on their way to or from the vineway to travel further afield. It was a short walk from the storehouse where the oacanout leaves were kept. Elanqo repurposed the barrow they had borrowed from Derria-Esto to fetch the first batch.

First of all, Elanqo tested the repaired machine.

They turned the handle and inside rocks of various shapes and sizes, arranged to get progressively smaller and sharper, tumbled through a coil of strong, tensioned mycelial wire. A small conveyor shelf moved at the same time, into the body of the machine, and out the other side.

Elanqo placed a handful of leaves on the conveyor and continued to turn the handle. A few moments later, the leaves emerged, shredded and crushed. Elanqo swept them into the barrow, then stepped back to contemplate the modifications needed. They had been figuring out how they would implement this for a long time.

Using a couple of the strange parts from their hideaway, they constructed a kind of fanned wheel that could be turned by the gently churning fountain. They rigged this to the handle of the machine and waited with baited breath. Slowly, it began to turn. Then it stopped. Elanqo scowled. Perhaps they'd need to get into the innards of the fountain after all. They glanced around, then brazenly and confidently began removing the carved panels from the base. Soon they had access to the pump. It was a straightforward tweak to increase the strength of the flow. Soon they had the handle turning consistently. Simple.

They moved the barrow to be in line with the end of the conveyor, so crushed leaves could fall into it directly. Then they just needed something to feed the leaves onto it.

Elanqo sidled around the corner of a nearby mound house, and into a slightly busier area. They saw what they needed almost at once.

"Zheni-Simbaya," Elanqo greeted the tall Germinated politely. "Are you well?"

"I am well, little E'lo," Zheni-Simbaya replied. "Though I am still burdened by the wants and needs of Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba, which are in conflict. What they need is to root and join the Old Ones. What they want is to go to the stars. Meanwhile, I must help them in and out of the brytosphere each day just to keep going."

Zheni-Simbaya was softly spoken, with a broad chest and large sad eyes. They gave an impression somehow of towering and diminishing at the same time. They were also genetically empowered to camouflage, their skin changing to blend in with their surroundings. The effectiveness of this was rather ruined by the heavy grey cloak which covered most of their body.

"If only there was a way for Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba to be in two places at once," said Elanqo, with a glance at the sky.

"I sense you need help with something yourself, little E'lo."

"I do," Elanqo kept their voice sincere. "These tall reed baskets you use to arrange the walking poles," they pointed into the den beyond. "Could I use one for... the work I'm doing with oacanout? They're the perfect dimensions. I'll return it, of course."

"You can, little E'lo." Zheni-Simbaya consolidated the contents of two of the tall narrow baskets into one, and brought the other back to Elanqo. "And with my warm wishes. But tell me: will you be fermenting the oacanout?"

"That's the plan," said Elanqo. "Would you like some?"

"If you can spare it, it's a great favourite of Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba. Perhaps you could take some to them directly when it is ready."

"I'd be more than happy to, Zheni-Simbaya. It would be my pleasure."

Zheni-Simbaya almost smiled - almost - and Elanqo walked slowly away, breaking into a sprint as soon as they rounded the corner. _Take fermented oacanout to one who should have long since rooted,_ they added to their mental task list for the next few days. _But I don't think the timing matters too much on that one_.

Elanqo ripped the bottom out of the basket, relegating the problem of repairing it to some future version of themself as well, and positioned it over one end of the conveyor. They stuffed it full of the oacanout leaves, and placed a weighty rock on top. The textured sides of the basket were perfect to stagger the leaves' release, and the rock slowly forced them down to land on the conveyor in a neat stream.

Elanqo took a moment to admire their handiwork. _Who says you can't be in two places at once_.

As they walked through the den, weaving between closely packed newtrees with narrow straight trunks no thicker than an arm, Elanqo scanned the overstory and found a direct connection to Bianqo. They'd been waiting to hear from them. Elanqo summarised their idea about dried mzemelnee and Bianqo agreed enthusiastically to come along.

On the way, Elanqo spotted the plumule Serina climbing a tree off to their left, and swerved into a detour with a quiet _aha_. Serina was a full five seasons older than Saba, but hadn't yet begun their germination. They had always been at home in trees, with long, strong arms and shorter crabbed legs. On the ground, they could usually be seen dashing about on four limbs instead of two. Here was a rare one who enjoyed the suspension bridge as much as Elanqo.

"Hey!" Elanqo called up. The newtree trunk was smooth and white with no branches or knots, but Serina had scaled it with ease. They were at the top, where the bark splayed out into a chaotic many-point star, as if it had suddenly hit the sky and not been able to stop growing in time.

"Catch!" Serina's face appeared briefly, and Elanqo held out their hands. Large blue flower heads began to drift down. Elanqo plucked them gently from the air and placed them in a neat row on the ground.

The flowers were not a part of the newtree, but grew in symbiosis with it. They were rootless plants which clung to the spread upper limbs of the tree, catching sunlight with enormous round leaves and exchanging it for the nutrients the newtree brought up from the ground in their own private wide net.

"Can you come down? Just quick."

Serina descended in a controlled slide down the straight trunk, stopping above Elanqo's head and looking down on them.

"So Saba's back, eh."

"Yeah. Two days. I wanted to ask about your Collection."

Serina cocked their head. It was bald, with no fronds or appendages or foliage, but framed on each side with two large, fan-like ears. "Go on."

"I need ball bearings for some of Derria-Esto's machines. Smooth and round." Elanqo got right to the point. "You have some."

"What size?"

Elanqo made a circle, touching the tips of two fingers.

"What for? Will they get damaged?"

"They'd get worn down over many seasons, but I just need them for today. You can have them back before there's any damage."

Serina nodded. "How many?"

"Eight."

"Okay. If you can help me with hanging flowers?"

"Sure, when-"

"Come to my Collection place after cacophony, okay?"

Elanqo nodded, and Serina disappeared back up the trunk, seemingly without moving their limbs at all.

Elanqo had to run the rest of the way to meet Bianqo outside of Elia-Amna's place in time.

Bianqo was already in conversation with Elia-Amno when Elanqo raced around the corner. Elia-Amna was as dark as night and wore a black baggy tunic, so at a quick glance they looked like an ill-matched shadow beside Bianqo. Elia-Amna had a lot of senses, with constantly twitching finger-like nodules covering their head and cheeks and running in quivering rows down their spine, arms and legs; but none of them could process sound. Bianqo and Elia-Amna, despite their close proximity, communicated via a private link in the overstory. Elanqo could sense their chatter as they walked over, but could not hear what they were saying. Bianqo heard Elanqo's approach, and looped them in at once. They were communicating not in words, but in sensations.

At once, Elanqo could tell that Elia-Amna was sharing information with the plumules that they didn't ought to be. There had been widespread concern about the glitch in the wide net earlier - so it hadn't just been localised - and a fear that Saba's germination journey had something to do with it. But Elanqo couldn't grasp how that conclusion could be reached. Saba had found something that might change the nature of the brytosphere? Exciting. Elanqo always knew Saba would change the world.

Elanqo observed passively for a while longer, then invoked a sense of tradition, a calling to their shared heritage, a connection with their cultural past. Bianqo weaved in their yearning for the stars, and together they laid the foundation of their request.

They were met with wry amusement from Elia-Amna. _These kids tell a good story._ But Elia-Amna did concede that the traditional dish was only really worthwhile to make with all of the correct ingredients. They agreed to discuss the matter with Melia-Adonde-Samamba in the third quarter.

And then Elia-Amna had a request to make of the plumules. They had detected a small surge in some kind of unusual exotic particles out by the Harshness. They had been planning to go there to investigate in person later that day. Perhaps Elanqo and Bianqo would do it instead?

Elia-Amna painted pictures in their minds of what they ought to be looking for, implanting sensations into their consciousness that they had no organs to detect in the herenow. It was confusing to start with, but Elanqo quickly adjusted and began to revel in the newness. Was this connected with the glitch in the wide net? It would be interesting to find out.

Bianqo went to resume their search for the more easily sourced ingredients for their ancient pudding, and they agreed to meet up with Elanqo at the start of third quarter.

Elanqo made haste back to Rainer Corner.

The machine was still running. A small crowd of very young plumules had gathered to watch. Elanqo took advantage of the opportunity at once.

"Come here," they beckoned three of the smaller young ones, barely knee-height, stubby little legs, blob-like bodies. They squeaked with delight as Elanqo taught them how to climb on top of one another and balance beside the tall basket. The others gathered around and soon got the hang of grabbing bundles of leaves from the pile in their short fingers, passing them along the line and up the teetering trio, the topmost of whom could just reach to drop them in the basket.

"Keep doing that," said Elanqo. "Careful, don't touch the conveyor. We can take the rock out if you're adding them at that speed. No that's perfect, keep it steady. I'm going to get more leaves. Practice, yes just like that until I get back."

When Elanqo returned the plumules had formed a more stable pyramid, and had run out of leaves, having figured out their peak operating efficiency already. _Wow_, thought Elanqo. _What a stroke of luck._

"Don't worry, the rest of you," they said to the disappointed few who hadn't managed to find a place in the operations. I'm going to get four more of them. Just... take it in turns now if you can? So you all get a practice. Careful! Don't push, you'll knock it over."

Elanqo set off to Serina's place, with just a couple of anxious glances back over their shoulder as they left.

The cacophony came, marking the beginning of second quarter. The neighbouring planet of Rannouckouch was rising, though Elanqo couldn't see it from where they were. The many creatures of the jungle voiced their surprise and delight at this every single day, the air filled with howls and screams, trills and caws. Birds took flight in huge masses, and insects that were usually silent found their clicking, shrieking, grating songs. Most of the plumules joined in too of course, and no small number of older people did as well. This lasted for as long as it took Rannouckouch to show its whole face in the sky. This was a particularly long time at the moment; the two planets were at the closest point to each other in their orbits.

Elanqo glanced up to see it emerging over the treetops nearby. The planet's face filled half of the sky, all rippling hazy streaks of oranges and reds. It's distant surface churned with immense cosmic storms, thrashing endlessly in a poison atmosphere.

Rannoukouch was almost completely overhead by the time the wild noises died down, but Elanqo was sure they could hear Serina yodeling in the distance from the high vantage point they doubtless occupied.

Serina's place was at the top of an ancient torrent tree. The tree was as broad as a mound house, and the center of the trunk was hollow. It still lived, widening by the tinest of fractions every monsoon. Thin branches burst from its sides, all the way from almost the ground to its top, arcing out and drooping down covered year-round in small squiggly pale green leaves. Elanqo pushed a curtain of them aside and felt their way towards the triangular slit that was the only person-sized entrance to the interior of the tree. They climbed deftly up a staggered series of small hand and foot holds that lined the inside of the trunk. Above their head hung woven hammocks, bags and pouches in all sizes, much like in the machine shed. These contained Serina's Collection. Unlike the machine shed, Serina's storage was arranged neatly in rows, ordered by size, meticulously sorted by function.

Elanqo scanned their surroundings and quickly deduced where they would find the ball bearings. But they weren't about to just help themself. Elanqo whistled. Serina must be in here somewhere.

Their expectations were met by a loud clatter and a yelp from somewhere out of sight. Elanqo hung off the wall, looking left and right to try to locate their friend.

"Hang there, give me a moment," came a muffled voice from below.

Serina eventually emerged from a deep hammock lower down. "Sorry," they grinned. "Just putting my instruments away." They ascended to Elanqo's level, swinging and leaping between the hammocks rather than using the steps on the walls. "Knowing you you've probably figured out where the parts you want are already."

Elanqo pointed.

"I should start moving things around to throw you off."

Serina reached into a pocket on the side of a large gently swinging pouch, and counted out eight ball bearings of the appropriate size. They handed them to Elanqo for inspection.

They were the same in size and shape to those that Derria-Esto had provided, but these were all weighted differently from each other. Elanqo didn't think that would matter for their role in the pulverisers. Elanqo held them up to their eye and examined them one by one. Most were translucent and hazy, but with some crystalline forms visible inside if you looked carefully enough. They were all dark in colour, but held up to the light some where smokey grey, others deep reds, greens or purples.

"I want them back," Serina reminded them.

Elanqo nodded. "I'll be done with them by the end of final quarter today. I can bring them back tonight, but-"

"If you are busy with prep for Saba it can wait until after the germination. Just... don't lose them."

"Got it." Elanqo squeezed Serina's shoulders in affectionate gratitude, dropped the balls into their tunic pocket, and made to go back down to the ground.

"Wait!" Serina laughed. "Flowers!"

Elanqo paused. "Can I just-"

"Go fix your machines," said Serina. "Then meet me in the creeper field."

Derria-Esto had the four broken pulverisors out and ready when Elanqo returned with the ball bearings.

"These don't need any processing at all," they commented, but didn't ask where Elanqo had got them from.

"They're temporary," said Elanqo as the two of them repaired the machines. "I'll get permanent replacements after the germination. Which probably _will_ want some processing.

By the time Elanqo was back at Rainer Corner, four new machines in tow on a low wheeled trolley, the audience of young plumules had tripled. This must be every ambulatory baby in the main den. Elanqo addressed them with arms crossed.

"Please tell me you haven't all escaped from somewhere else you're supposed to be."

There was a non-too-reassuring babble of sounds from the group, some laughter, some partly formed words, and a series of rapid excited emotes aimed at Elanqo across the overstory from the handful of older ones who knew how to broadcast on the high net. The group who were currently operating the pulveriser were fixated on their task, and another cluster stood nearby, clearly expecting to take the next shift.

Elanqo decided they'd just let this play out. They would have time to check back here over the course of the day, and hopefully anyone who was supposed to be supervising the plumules would find them doing something apparently useful and leave them to it.

The young ones swarmed around Elanqo as they set up the other four machiens in a circle around the fountain. They were accompanied by a small curious gaggle of them when they went for a quick walk around to procure more baskets, which meant they had help to carry the baskets back.

With five machines set up, almost all of the plumules were part of a team loading leaves. The ones who weren't seemed to have a tendency towards supervision and oversight. They wandered between their peers, checking on things and muttering to each other in baby talk, or inspecting the crushed oacanout leaves and sending bigger chunks back for reprocessing.

Just in case something went wrong with their makeshift water wheel, Elanqo taught some of the plumules how the machine handles worked, as well.

That all took a bit longer than expected. Elanqo raced off to the creeper field to meet Serina.

The creeper field was on the side of a broad gentle slope that descended ultimately into a dense wetland which was inaccessible to all but those specialised for that terrain. It was an open area of ground like somebody had drawn a rough, messy circle on a map of the jungle and simply disappeared all of the trees and larger flora inside the line. Instead, the whole area was hung with trailing plants of all kinds. Several especially thick vines provided the core, strung across the clearing between trees on either side, and everything else hung from those. Elanqo could reach the lowest of them from the wet, mossy ground if they stood on tiptoe and stretched, and they crisscrossed upwards in a complicated tangle to the height of the tallest trees, keeping most of the sunlight out and casting dappled moving shadows over everything.

The made their way across the cold lumpy ground, wishing they had thought to grab some books on the way. Serina was pulling a section of vines lower so that they hung in rows and were reachable from the ground. An enormous sack of blue flowers from the newtrees hung from a sturdy branch at the edge of the clearing.

"I think that should be enough," Serina panted, lowering another chunk of creeper with a tug. "Have you drained arraressa before?"

Elanqo shook their head. Arraressa pollen contained a catalyst, a crucial component for many types of 'duction. It was also a hallucinogen.

"Like this," Serina brought one of the flower heads over and showed Elanqo how to prise it apart. Beneath a tightly bunched nest of petals was a pair of long, fibrous tendrils with a tensile strength to rival mycelial wire. Serina uncoiled the tendrils and used them to tie the flower head to a vine. Then they poked a hole in the back, where the flower head had been detached from its stem. "You've gotta get right in until you feel this squishy sack bit. Feel that? Yeah. Make a little hole. You can use a sharp stick if you want. Then hang one of these underneath it." Serina produced a gauze pouch with pegged handles that attached neatly to the vine on either side of the flower head and hung beneath as if to catch it were the knot to come undone. Elanqo watched as a syrupy blob appeared in the hole Serina had made, and slowly dripped onto the waiting fabric.

"The cloth has a special lining. It holds onto the pollen and the rest of it gradually soaks through and out the other side."

"How long does it take to get all of it?"

"We'll probably leave these here for the rest of the damp season. There's only maybe one or two harvests left."

They worked in silence for a while. Elanqo let their body go into autopilot while they checked into the synctium to see what the next stage of processing the arraessa would be before it oculd be used in 'duction. It involved heating and distilling and a reaction with another plant extract, another complicated looking filter, and more distillations.

"Hey, watch what you're doing."

Elanqo snapped back to the herenow. They had only intended to make a shallow connection to the synctium, but it was easy to get called in deeper. They had let go of the last of their physical control for a moment, and dropped the flowers they had been holding onto the ground.

"Oops," Elanqo picked them up quickly before they absorbed too much moisture from the moss underfoot. "I'm concentrating," they grinned.

"When will you go for your germination journey?" Elanqo asked all of a sudden.

"Huh?"

"You must have thought about it. What's your plan?"

"Oh. I don't think I'm going to do one."

Elanqo almost dropped the flower again.

"What do you mean? But you _have_ to do one."

"Who says?"

"Well, i'ts just. Everone does. How will you, you know, grow up?"

"Can't stop me from growing up," said Serina. "And can't stop me from getting 'ductions too, if I need them. I don't mind missing out on all those Germinated special meetings and consultations you know. Gives me more time for my Collection, and other things."

Elanqo was aghast. They had thought that Serina's body was just running a big behind the average schedule, not that they were _choosing_ not to... "But how is it possible? I mean if you're going to flower you need to be Germinated. Don't you?"

Serina shrugged. "I guess I'll find out in a few dozen seasons. Maybe I can just be a plumule forever."

Elanqo tried to imagine this, but they couldn't really make sense of the idea. To germinate and flower was the pattern of life. You only got a choice about things after that. They all needed the flowered to put things back into the brytosphere, instead of only taking out. It kept the balance. Elanqo decided that to choose not to germinate, and by implication not to flower, must be a truly selfish behaviour.

"Serina..." Elanqo ventured. "Are you happy only to consume, and never to create anything for others?"

"What are you talking about? I create plenty. I'm doing this work that only older plumules or Germinated can really do, and most plumules don't have the attention span and Germinated are too busy busy busy. I do this for days at a time, you know. I look after my Collection. I always have things that people need. And anyway, I know what you're really talking about. And I already know how to feed into the brytosphere. You don't have to be flowered to do it. I figured it out myself."

"How-"

"But that' snot really my point. All this is valuable in the herenow. All this is _real_. We existed without the wide net once, you know."

"That's not true." Elanqo frowned. Could it be?

Serina shrugged. "You'll figure it out your way. Do your journey across the desert. See if you find... or lose... the same thing as Saba at the other end."

They were both silent for a while.

"Okay, so I have a couple of other errands to run. You'r eokay to finish this for me, right?"

Elanqo looked at the massive pile of flowers still to hang, their heart sinking. But Serina _had_ lent them part of their Collection. And plenty to think about. And they didn't want them to think they were suddenly unwilling because of the germination thing.

"Sure," Elanqo croaked. "I'll finish it."

As soon as Serina was out of sight, Elanqo slumped down into the wet ground. Water quickly seeped into their tunic but they paid no attention. They sunk at once into the synctium.

_Did People exist before the brytosphere?_

But the memories they found were fuzzy and confused. They seemed to contain people who weren't quite People, who looked and moved similarly but were fundamentally strange, isolated beings. Short lives. Always in conflict with their surroundings. Trying to change everything except themselves.

Elanqo couldn't wait to talk about this with Saba. There _were_ people on separate networks on the other side of the desert. Perhaps Saba had spoken to them. Perhaps that was who the distorted past dreams of the synctium were about. Saba wasn't supposed to make contact with any other societies on their germination journey. It was supposed to be about isolation and reflection. But maybe they had anyway. Maybe they'd had no choice.

Elanqo's heart raced with the possibilities.

They couldn't stand here hanging flowers all day.

Every so often, the upper canopy of the creepers shook or twitched. Some part of the vineway was connected into here, and sometimes there was a surge that reached this place. It wasn't usually strong enough to shake the lower vies so Elanqo was taken aback when a trembling rush threw a couple of flowers loose and to the ground.

"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry."

Elanqo jumped at the voice. The plants above their head rustled again, and a pair of dark green legs appeared. After some wriggling, these were followed by a fuzz-covered body, arms and head; a Germinated appeared who could have passed for a fern growing from a mossy mound if they sat still long enough. Elanqo couldn't even tell if they were naked or clothed. Nor did Elanqo recognise them.

"Who are you?"

The stranger picked up another flower they had knocked loose, and retied it. It looked like they had done that before.

"I'm called Belline-Tamaa. I'm really sorry, I didn't realise there was someone working here, or I would have gone around. Wow, this all looks like a very relaxing job."

"I'm Elanqo. Would you... Like to help?"

"You know, I'd really love to. I don't have enough time for things like this in my life. But I lost something in the river and I have to get it before it's gone for good."

Elanqo looked quizzical.

"I've been tracking it for some days now. It's got lodged in the rocks at the bottom of Aerina Falls, so I have a chance to retrieve it. I don't know how long it'll be there." Belline-Tamaa sighed. "The thing is, I hate the water."

"Really? I love the water. I'm adapted for cold too and I can make oxygen myself so I can stay underwater for a long time. Maybe I can help you?"

Elanqo almost at once regretted overstating their oxygen generating capabilities. They _could_ do it, but slowly and in small amounts, and they had no sunlight receptors that would enable them to photosynthesise directly. One day, though.

Belline-Tamaa's leaf-shrouded eyes went wide. "Really? You'd do that?"

"I can if... if you can hang the flowers. I have to go to the Harshness later for something else anyway. What have you lost?"

"I would gladly swap a dive into the river for a whole day of draining arraressa. What I've lost is, well. I'ts a piece of mya rt."

It was Elanqo's turn to widen their eyes. Artists were few and far between around the main den. They considered Serina and their collection as on the fringe, but they had never actually met a real Germinated artist.

"Where are you from?"

"Oh, I'm from the eastern mountains," said Belline-Tamaa with a smile. "Do you know a place called Morriton Seefar?" Then without waiting for an answer: "I heard earlier there's a germination celebration soon, bringing some interesting reports from the others ide ofthe desert. I'd thought only to pass through on my way to the coast but I believe I'll stay."

"Yes! That's Saba, my sibfriend. I'm helping with the preparations."

"Okay, come here. I'll share where to look and what for."

The lost artwork was a model in the shape of a bird. It was part of a bigger piece that had become detached and fallen into a mountain stream. That stream became a small river, which eventually joined to the main body of the Harshness. Belline-Tamaa had lost it for a while then, but tracked it down by using the overstory in ways Elanqo had never heard of.

Elanqo knew the part of the river they needed to look in. It wasn't far form the entrance to their hideaway.

_I hope Serina doesn't mind that I've left a stranger with this task,_ Elanqo thought as they climbed back up the hill from the creeper field. But the important thing was that the work got done, not who did it.

-----

The river was wide and fast, almost rapids. It sliced through the land, with steep rocky banks. Yet the Harshness didn't truly earn its name until after the Western Falls, many miles fromthe main den. Elanqo had never been there in person.

They looked nervously over a precipice at Aerino Falls and wondered for the fifth time if they should let Bianqo know where they were. Bianqo was expecting to join them around here for the errand they had pomised to run for Eliya-Amna in any case.

Elanqo climbed carefully down the craggy sides. The rocks jutted in ways that made convenient hand and foot holds, and were festooned with handy, deeply rooted plants which were easy to grab onto whenever their foot slipped.

They determined to ask Belline-Tamaa more about art in the eastern mountains when they got back and wondered what they would make of the lichen map that was almost finished.

Rannouckouch filled the sky almost directly overhead. The river below flashed golden where it wasn't churning foam, reflecting the planet's dramatic light. Soon it would begin to cast a shadow, and third quarter would be beginning.

An incongruous shape caught Elanqo's eye. Caught among large, floating flat leaves, just where Belline-Tamaa said it wold be. It moved and bobbed with the foliage, and for a split second Elanqo thought it was about to break free and be swept away. They hastened their climb, missed an outcrop, slipped and fell amidst a rattle of loose stones.

Elanqo groaned as they sat up on a mud bank at the very edge of the water. The distance hadn't been far but enough to bruise their back and behind. By habit they almost went directly to the brytosphere to heal, but caught themself. No time for that right now and it certainly wasn't the place.

The object was about a third of the way across the water. The river here was wide, and its choppy surface scattered with rocks and leaves made it look shallow, but Elanqo knew that this was deceptive. Dark patches where the water rushed past, slick and smooth as glass, betrayed its sudden depths.

Elanqo braced themself against a rock and relaxed into the synctium, in search of some sort of map or guide to this stretch of the Harshness, or even just a memory of someone who had crossed here before. But everything they found was too old, or just did not match. The river was too fickle, changing its character every season or more. They were going to have to just go for it. Elanqo pulled their tunic over their head and hung it over a jutting branch.

They waded out until the water reached their chest. THey held their arms aloft, parallel with the surface of the water to keep balance over the uneven river bed. Mud sucked at their feet and strands of algae teased at their legs.

Half the distance to the object and they could feel the silt underfoot tapering sharply downwards. Another step and they cracked their knee against a hidden rock and winced. Something grazed their thigh. They stretched their arms forward and lifted their feet from the mud. Immediately they felt the Harshness try to carry them downstream, not with force but softly, tuggingly, a suggestion more than a demand. Elanqo resisted and pushed themself forward, perpendicular to the current, using rocks and roots as holdfasts and launching off points.

The object - the shape of a bird with wings outstretched was clear now in spite of being upside down - was caught amongst a tangle of foliage dead and alive, an accumulation of fallen leaves and bits of stick that had built up between a boulder that formed a miniature island in the middle of the flow, and a huge, arcing tree root that extended from the opposite bank like a giant muddy claw.

Elanqo sized the tree root up as they approached it. It would probably be easier to get back out that way, though it would put them on the wrong side of the river for Eliya-Amna's errand, and mean going the long way back to the main den.

_At least it's not at the bottom._

The bird was about the size of Elanqo's torso. They grabbed for it with one hand, stretching over the mud and twigs, and hooked a finger around enough of the frame to tug at it, but it was lodged fast. Elanqo sighed and tried to climb on the boulder island. It wa sslick with algae, with enough texture to be sharply painful but not enough to get a grip on. They scrambled around the other side of it and got a hold on an offshoot of the giant tree root. This was pretty slimy too, but much easier to grip, and Elanqo pulled themself out of the water and climbed around the root until they were looking down on the bird from above. The only way to reach it was for Elanqo to wrap their legs tight around part of the root, and swing upside down. They locked their ankles together, twisting them around each other ina  way that made them look broken, and stretched out their arms to grasp the bird in both hands. THey pulled hard and it lifted free of the mood with a slurping sound that was audible even over the rush of the water. For its size, the piece didn't weigh very much. Elanqo couldn't tell what it was made of, even after they righted themself and examined it more closely, legs still wrapped tight around the root.

Elanqo made their way carefully along the top of the root. It was wide enough to put one foot in front of the other, but not by much. They held the bird out in front of them to help with balance, and wished they had a tail as well. They glanced back once with regret at their tunic, hanging limp on the other side of the river like a little yellow flag with no wind to lift it.

Mostly Elanqo wondered if there was anything in the pocket it would be worth retrieving it for, and decided it could all wait until later.

They found a message from Bianqo on the high net. They were delayed on their way to the Harshness, but would catch up with Elanqo as soon as possible.

Elanqo reflected on the location that Eliya-Amna had shared with them both and walked upriver, pushing through undergrowth as they tried to work out exactly where they should go. The bird model kept getting caught on leaves and branches and Elanqo was starting to run out of patience for wrestling it free. Sharp scratchy plants and stinging leaves attacked the parts of Elanqo's body normally at least somewhat protected by clothes. By the time they reached a proper track, they were feeling distinctly miserable. _Should have just stuck to hanging flowers._

Bianqo didn't seem to be anywhere close yet, and Elanqo wasn't all that far from their hideaway. It would be a welcome detour to have a chance to wash the mud and blood and algae off their body, and perhaps check on the progress of their lichen as well.

"Good day, Elanqo," the Voice greeted them as usual. "What do you have there?"

Elanqo slammed the mud-crusted leaf-spattered bird on a work bench a little harder than they intended. "It's art."

Having washed themself in the little basin in the corner and dried themself on a sheet they found in a storage draw, Elanqo was starting to feel better.

"What do you know about _proximian_ particles?" They asked the Voice while they carefully cleaned off the spindly frame of the bird under the tap. To Elanqo's surprise, the Voice answered at once.

"Proximian particle is a colloquial term for a class of molecules which includes repron-3-5, repron-3-6 and allendite. These are waste products of several common energy generation methods, though I'd have to read around a bit if you wanted to know the details. They're harmless to the natural environment."

Elanqo frowned. None of that made much sense. "Energy comes from the sun," they said. "Why would there be proximian particles near here? Can you detect them?"

There was a pause. "You're right, I'm detecting repron-3-5 about one and a half kilostomps west of here. That's unusual."

"I think Eliya-Amna thought so too. Wait, did I leave a change of clothes here a while back?"

"In the fourth cupboard from the right."

"Thanks!" Elanqo dropped the bird in the sink and went to look. They found a brown tunic crumpled up at the bottom of the cupboard where it had fallen from a hook. It had a dark green stain down the front. "Oh right. I remember why I left this here." But it was better than nothing.

When Elanqo had cleaned the bird off completely, they examined it more closely. Its form was shaped from a single continuous strand about as thick as Elanqo's finger, but flat. The strand had been bent and twisted and curved around itself in a way that reminded Elanqo of basket weaving, though this was far more intricate than any basket they had ever seen. They couldn't figure out how the material could have been flexible enough to form into the shape, yet so immovably rigid now. The strand was carved with tiny letters in an elaborate script that Elanqo didn't recognise. They followed the weave around, turning the bird over in their hands, looking for an end or a break in the markings, but it was continuous.

"What is art?" Elanqo asked the Voice.

"That is art," said the voice. Elanqo imagined a smirk behind the neutral tones.

"How do _you_ define art, I mean."

"Art is an activity that involves the creation of objects, sounds or combinations of words that bring pleasure to an audience, but serves no practical function. It is a process of creative invention based on emotion or instinct."

"Hmm." That didn't quite seem right.

"Okay, fine, tell me about the eastern mountains?"

"The eastern mountains are unexplored. Nothing is known about them. Some people speculate that they're inhospitable to most life."

Elanqo rolled their eyes. "Well obviously not, as people live there. And make art, even."

The ramapid and ilyarid lichens were developing as Elanqo had hoped, which was a relief. The semaphid hadn't done a lot, but it wasn't dead. Maybe it would get a growth spurt later. They decided not to mess with any of them further for now.

--------

Elanqo met Bianqo by a grove of sruba trees. The location the Voice had described, and that Eliya-Amna had conveyed were more or less identical.

Bianqo gesticulated at the air. _There's nothing here._

Elanqo remembered the sensations that Eliya-Amna had shared with them. "I think Eliya-Amna would 'see' something if they were here. let's just look for anything out of the ordinary."

Bianqo pointed at the bird model in Elanqo's hand. "Oh, this is for someone else. Errand trade. I pulled it from the river." The two of them searched around for a while but came up with nothing. No growths, no weird smells, no unusual air currents, no strange pieces of mysterious machines. Then Elanqo had an idea.

They sat down and connected with the wide net. The presence of the brytosphere differed depending on where you were in the herenow; they could tell at once that something was off. They were walking through a tunnel - a very normal and common experience - with indistinct sides and dome overhead; they seemed close in, but Elanqo couldn't touch them if they reached out their arms. It was like being surrounded by a thick insubstantial fog, but more defined, more bounded. The path to walk through the tunnel was clear, there was no need for a guide in this manifestation. Wisps of mist curled around Elanqo's ankles and rose unbidden up to their body, healing scrapes and bruises. The ground, which looked like rock with a thin layer of haze covering it, rose and fell under each footstep.

What was wrong was the smell.

There should be no smell in the brytosphere. There was no air to carry one, no physicality at all. Any such sensations one thought they felt were illusions, tricks the brain played on itself as it searched for the familiarity of the herenow. Usually this took the form of touch, of the texture and solidity of the ground underfoot.

But the smell was sharp and real, bitter and acrid, not like any plant Elanqo had every encountered. They fell to a crawl, still shuffling forwards, but curled up as tightly in on themself as they could, and the brytosphere let them go.

Bianqo had followed suit, and was standing very still, resting lightly against the trunk of a tree. Bianqo always connected to the wide net standing up; Elanqo thought this was quite weird.

It wasn't long before they re-emerged too. They went from uncanny stillness, looking for all the world like a part of the tree they stood beside, to animated gesturing with astonishing rapidity. Elanqo had never seen them move so much all at once.

"Yes, I smelled that too. What could it be? Do you think we should be worried?"

They speculateda bout the possible causes as they walked along a well-used trail back to the main den. They both connected to the wide net again in different places for comparison, and found everything normal. At least they had something to report to Eliya-Amna.

-------

Rainer corner was deserted when Elanqo finally got back. A small mountain range of shredded oacanout leaves formed a semicircle around the pulverisors, with the innocently burbling fountain at the center of it all. The baskets had been picked clean of any trace of green, and neatly stacked; bits and pieces of their ripped-out bottom piled carefully into the top one. The waterwheels had all been removed, so the machines were still and quiet.

Elanqo gawped for a moment. Never had a plan of theirs been executed so well.

The main den was in full shadow now, and Rannockouch was starting to dip below the opposite horizon. Elanqo had left Bianqo to give their report to Eliya-Amna, and still did'nt know whether or not they had procured the mzemelnee. But they had crossed paths with Dimiti on the way to Rainer Corner, who had been running around consulting and collecting, cooking and testing, and was confident that they could make the dish - bish hon nee - the name of which they had finally uncovered from the synctium as well.

Elanqo still carried the bird art, which seemed to be getting heavier and more unwieldy by the moment. Several people had stopped them to ask about it on the way here.

They put it down on the edge of the fountain, in the middle of the circle of pulverisors, where it should be mostly out of sight of overly curious passers-by, and loaded up Derria-Esto's barrow with shredded leaves. Before trundling them off in the direction of the preserving lodge, Elanqo opened up each pulversior in turn and removed the coloured spheres that had been serving as ball bearings. They dropped them into the stained pocket of their tunic, where they clinked dully against each other as Elanqo walked.

Dimiti met them at the preserving lodge.

"We got it! Melia-Adonde-Samamba has given us enough mzemelnee for sixty four portions, if they're small. I've already taken it and the rest of th ingredients to Maker Sonde-Ullinera. The only thing is, Melia-Adonde-Samamba wants us to collect something for them."

Elanqo and Dimiti were joined by another of Saba's sibfriends, Usumara, at the preserving lodge, and the three of them spent the rest of third quarter packing the oacanout leaves into large ceramic jars. These would be lidded and buried for a longnight and a day, while the yeasts that lived naturally on them did their work. They would come out transformed, the pungent smell sweetened and the dark bitterness made salty, light and crisp. Everyone loved fermented oacanout leaves, even Bianqo. There wasn't an occasion in existence that didn't call for it.

------------

Elanqo stood in the creeper field with their mouth open and eyes wide. They clutched the bird to their chest, lost for words entirely.

"What do you think?" Belline-Tamaa called from a tangle of vines overhead. "It looks good, right?"

The vines that Serina had strung in careful rows, aligned to be equal distances apart, taking up exactly the amount of space needed for the flower heads and no more, had been completely rearranged. They were crisscrossed into a gigantic web in three dimensions, with the flowers scattered throughout like flies caught in a spider's trap. As far as Elanqo could tell, all of the flowers were hanging, correctly slung with the gauze pouches, but getting them all back down would be a nightmare.

Belline-Tamaa dropped to the ground beside Elanqo with a soft squelch.

"Thank you!" They said brightly, taking the bird. "I hope it wasn't too much trouble to get. You've changed your clothes."

"Why did you-"

"Come over here, look at it from this direction."

Elanqo allowed themself to be lead a little way around the edge of the clearing, back to the beginning of the track that went to the main den. This put them on slightly higher ground, so they could see more of the depth to the... arrangement.

"Look," Belline-Tamaa pointed. "Can you see it?"

Elanqo's perception adjusted suddenly, and instead of a chaotic tangle of creepers and blue petals they saw one giant flower head, with its filaments pointing straight up to the sky, curling at the ends, as if suspended from an invisible vine. Elanqo laughed.

Belline-Tamaa grabbed their wrist and pulled them into the very center of the clearing, then lay down on the soggy moss. "Come, come, looks straight up at the middle."

Elanqo did as they were bid, soaking the back of their tunic in the process. The view from below was like...

"It's a newtree?" They asked in awe. "As if we were in the center of the trunk, looking up at the branches spread all around?"

"That's right!"

"But... I mean, you know it can't stay like this. It's going to be so much extra work to collect the arraressa. I don't know what Serina is going to say."

"I know," Belline-Tamaa laughed. "It's just for fun. Nothing lasts forever. Or even all the way from sunrise to sunset."

"Is this art?"

"Yes, Elanqo, it certainly is."

"How do you know? What is art and what isn't, I mean?"

"It's up to you really. There's no right or wrong answer. How does it make you feel? Does it stir your heart, or your mind? Does it make you think of things you've never thought of before?"

"So art is things that make you feel things, but doesn't _do_ anything?"

"No. Sometimes. It depends. Let me tell you something not many people know. In the eastern mountains, most people believe that works of art aren't a want, they're a _need_."

"Woah. How many artists are there?"

"Everyone is an artist in some way. And there are more kinds of art than you can count. And people argue all the time about exactly what you just asked - whether a particular thing is art or not."

"Really!" Elanqo had never heard any of this before. Their impression of the eastern mountains had been of a cold, boring place with no colourful plants and way more open space than seemed safe.

"You can get things - nourishment - from art that you'll never be able to get from the brytosphere."

Such a concept was so far from Elanqo's experience of the world that they almost thought that Belline-Tamaa was winding them up. But they seemed so sincere. So excited about it all. Elanqo wondered what Saba would make of all this. They sat up.

"I have to go. Serina might... I don't know-"

Belline-Tamaa stayed on their back and waved a leafy hand. "I'll finish up here, then find a place in the main den for myself for the night. Perhaps I'll see you later."

Elanqo nodded, their anxiety about Serina's reaction to the arrangement of the creeper field irrationally eased by Belline-Tamaa's offhand manner.

The sun was back out, and Rannouckouch was well on its way down, unseen behind the trees from the path. The fourth and final quarter of the day had begun.

For the first time that day, Elanqo walked without knowing where they were going. They were tired and overwhelmed by all of the things still to be done. But which task to do next? They piled up in Elanqo's mind, all as urgent as each other, competing for their attention.

Elanqo shook them all away. They realised they had been walking away from the main den rather than towards it. Their feet were taking them automatically back to the hideaway. They let them.

The lichen hadn't changed much since they were last there.  
They waited for the usual banal greeting from the Voice, fully prepared to ignore it completely, but the Voice must somehow have sensed this, because it remained silent. Elanqo crossed the room where the lichen map was, and went through a doorway at the far end.

They hadn't realised there was a door here for a full season. They only found it eventually because of an offhand comment from the Voice at one point. It had been a slit in the wall, barely visible. The Voice hadn't been able to open it for them - its ability to control the various mechanisms in the place seemed to be patchy - but had directed Elanqo eventually to a thin but strong bar, and Elanqo had prised the opening just wide enough to squeeze through. It had stayed open.

The door led to a gently curving, downward sloping corridor. The floor was soft, like moss, but different; dry. Like the rest of the place, there was no light in the corridor, but Elanqo's sight was good enough to see that there was nothing else in the place.

Around the final curve there finally was a flicker of light; an algae green, dim, rippling and moving, creating patterns on the floor and walls. The slopes levelled out and the corridor widened into an oval room with a matching oval window in the ceiling above. The light that came through the window was filtered by the water of the Harshness. The corridor and the room were deep under the river, deeper than Elanqo had ever known anyone to go.

The corridor continued from the other end of the room, in a mirror image of the section that Elanqo had followed from the room with the Voice. At the far end of that was another door. This one, Elanqo had never been able to open.

Elanqo lay down in the middle of the room, staring up at the distorted glimmerings above. Flecks of gold from the late day sun sometimes found their way through, but the water was hazy with life and the sky felt very far away. Sometimes Elanqo imagined they were in the brytosphere, and revelled in being able to lie completely still. There was no sound here at all, though sometimes Elanqo imagined they could hear the currents crashing against the window and walls. Occasionally, Elanqo caught glimpses of deep river life from here, things that never made it to the surface.

Elanqo thought about slipping into the brytosphere for some restoration, but a giant urchid drifted past directly overhead. Its roughly spherical body was crusted with gnarly shellfish that somehow managed a rainbow iridescence despite the gloom. Tendrils of weeds tailed out behind it. It moved slowly, hardly seeming to move at all, but Elanqo was captivated by its passage.

Before they could refocus and reach the brytosphere, Elanqo fell asleep.

Sleep was something that came rarely to Elanqo. They didn't need it. They didn't enjoy it. It felt like wasted time. There were some, like Dimiti, who did need to sleep, and Elanqo was glad they weren't one of them. Weariness, confusion, heavy limbs, blurry thoughts, all of these could be healed by the brytosphere in far less time and far more thoroughly than by leaving the body to its own devices.

Yet there was something about this room that regressed Elanqo to an infantile state, to a time before they could consciously tap into the wide net, when sleep was necessary and frequent.

They didn't dream, or at least nothing coherent. Images of the day, all mixed up, cascaded through their mind> Giant blue flowers tumbling over waterfalls; waterfalls of shredded leaves; thousands of tiny plumule hands ripping the trees apart into smaller and smaller pieces.

They were awoken by a persistent tugging ache in their head, which turned out to be Bianqo desperately searching for them on the high net.

Elanqo sat bolt upright at once. How much time had passed? The view overhead certainly seemed darker.

Bianqo had obtained information about the errand Melia-Adonde-Samamba wanted them to run, and was setting off to do it themself. It was a simple thing; just to collect a ceremonial incense pot from someone on the other side of the main den who had been repairing it.

It was almost completely dark when Elanqo emerged from the hideaway. They were angry with themself for losing track of all that time, and for disappearing on their sibfriends who were still working so hard for Saba. If anything, the sleep had made them feel even more bleary than before> Elanqo didn't know how Dimiti could do this every single night!

They passed through the creeper fields on the way back to the main den. The art was gone. The flowers hung in perfectly neat rows, just one layer across the clearing. Elanqo stopped and tugged at the fronds on their head. Had they imagined Belline-Tamaa? Was that another dream?

They hurried on.

Elanqo coordinated with Bianqo via the overstory, and contrived to meet them near the edge of the main den. It was hard to deceive through an exchange of sensory imagery, but Elanqo was pretty sure they managed to leave the impression, by way of explanation for their absence, that they had been in the brytosphere all this time.

In any case, Bianqo was preoccupied.

Hamasha-Vini had given them yet another errand to fulfil.

The ceremonial incense pot that Hamasha-Vini had repaired on behalf of Melia-Adonde-Samamba was newly intact after it had slipped off a shelf onto a hard floor. But the contents had spilled too, and needed to be replaced.

Sinsy flowers grew only in one place in the vicinity of the main den, and opened to release their hypnotic fragrance only once the sun had set. The Gully of the Long Night had been one of Elanqo's favourite places to ruminate before they had found the hideaway, and they realised it had been a surprisingly long time since they were last here.

Elanqo and Bianqo reached the Gully after a silent, trudging walk along a wide track, then a narrow, overgrown offshoot of the path, and down an uneven, winding, almost vertical set of steps that someone had built from rocks that certainly were not local, many generations before.

Elanqo sensed Bianqo's fixation on the moon again, but did not ask about it. The colony there were at the cutting edge of discovery, especially relating to 'duction and weather control. They weren't at a stage where they had transformed the arid surface yet, but several hundred people from all over Nemata lived in a network of lush tunnels very similar to the moss caves. Anyone who wanted to join them needed a lot of adaptations, for the thin atmosphere and low gravity, as much as everything else. Every ten seasons or so a new transport was ready to take another cohort, and the number of people who wanted to join that particular adventure was growing all the time. Especially with the most recent news, that they had finally managed to start the growth of their own brytosphere.

The Gully was a place of gentleness, and Elanqo felt their mood soften as they approached. There was a quiet trickle of water from somewhere unseen, and the glow of Farne, by now right overhead, highlighted everything in a mellow blue.

The steps led all the way to the bottom of the narrow chip out of the land. The muddy sides were wide enough apart for three people to walk abreast, but no more. Every monsoon season, it got a little deeper and a little longer, but never any winder. The sides were thickly adorned with hanging flowers; three or four different types, the sinsy included, which could only be found here. They all opened at night, turning their faces towards Farne and following it across the sky. Only one of the four stayed open in sunlight.

The sinsy flowers were delicate, and a ghostly white. They appeared to be edged with blue in the moonlight, and  had some glittering quality to them. They were mixed in between the much larger _flight of fancy_ flowers, which had thick, droopy deep purple petals, and would have disappeared into the backdrop but for their scent; and the _navigator's friend_, with minuscule heads smaller than a fingertip, which glowed yellow and speckled huge swathes of the gully walls like stars in a crowded night sky. The gemilar blooms grew apart from the rest, creeping mostly along the ground, and a little way up the sides; leaf-shaped flowers in shades of bronze and copper, on vines that had no leaves of their own at all, but borrowed energy readily from all of the subterranean networks that were present in the gully.

None of these flowers were to be picked. Elanqo and Bianqo stepped carefully, disturbing as little as possible as they made their way towards the headwall of the gully where the sinsy flowers were thickest. Night moths flilled around their heads, drunk on the moonlight and curious about the visitors to their domain.

They scoured the ground at the base of the wall, stooped over, searching beneath the gemilar for the fallen dried husks of spent sinsy. Sometimes Elanqo could hone in on them using the fragrance alone; they smelled warm and peppery. Inhaling too much made Elanqo's nose tingle.

They each had a small pouch, and worked until they were full, careful not to crush the husks as they fished them out of the undergrowth.

-------------------

Hamasha-Vini greeted the pair with gratitude and relief when they returned to their workshop in the main den. The pair watched as Hamasha-Vini filled the various sections of the pot with dried flowers, closing and opening compartments in a very particular order. They clicked the final one into place and handed the bot to Bianqo.

"Thank you both so much," Hamasha-Vini said to Elanqo in a soft, raspy voice. "It would have been so hard for me to find the time to go to the gully tonight, and waiting for the next longnight really would have been too long."

------

Elanqo and Bianqo spent the rest of the longnight with a group of young plumules, teaching them to weave garlands from strands of bright rainbow vines. Stubby plumule fingers with less developed hand-eye coordination were not well-suited to the task, but it was traditional that people of every generation, all who had interacted with Saba at any time, took part. The result was invariably a chaotic tangle of colour that made the germination platform, when they strung up their decorations, look like some kind of floral explosion.

Elanqo heard familiar voices behind them, and turned.

Serina and Belline-Tamaa approached, in animated conversation.

"...a completely arbitrary point in someone's life! So many people have to make these decisions about their name, their bodies, before they're really ready," argued Serina.

"The germination journey is supposed to make us ready, isn't it? And that can take as much or as little time as you need. Saba, for example," Belline-Tamaa gave a node and a little wave to Elanqo, "perhaps - now I don't know of course, I never met them and I don't know what happened out there," (Elanqo thought the seemed to stress that point a little too much, for some reason) "- perhaps they weren't quite ready to leave when they did, and that's why they've taken a bit longer to return."

"But nobody should have to _leave_ before they're ready either. It's synchronised with the seasons, which has no actual connection with individual development. And there's this pressure when you reach a particular age. If you miss damp season you have to wait a whole monsoon before you can go, and then you're suddenly too old, you're late, you're weird."

"You're right, that pressure is not good. That's something we can work on. But I thought you are arguing that the germination ceremony itself is a problem."

Serina shrugged. "That's just a party. But all the ritual around it, the declaration of name, the discoveries, this idea that you have a plan, a path. I find it all a bit... obscene."

"You argue like a Germinated, Serina," said Belline-Tamaa with a wink. "Hey look, Elanqo, you're making art."

"Obscene, ritualistic art," Elanqo grinned back.

"Oh, you two have met?"

"Yeah, they-"

"Serina showed me your handiwork in the creeper field," Belline-Tamaa interrupted. "That was a lot of work. Well done."

"Uh. Thanks." Weird. "Hey, Serina," Elanqo scrambled up from their squat. "Here are your balls." They scooped them out of their tunic pocket and offered them to Serina in cupped hands. Serina pocketed them themself.

"Thanks. I hope they were useful."

"They were. You're going to love what I rigged up. But I do need to find a permanent solution soon."

Serina and Belline-Tamaa joined the circle of garland makers, Serina grumbling about ceremony and ritual all the while they twisted their knots and loops with nimble practised fingers. Belline-Tamaa was a little more clumsy, like they hadn't done it before.

As the longnight wore on, the circle grew and grew. As well as more Germinated, including Palemilia-Kimini and Derria-Esto, elder Flowered came along too, and the younger plumules were gradually untangled and taken away to bed.

To everyone's surprise, the ancient Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba hobbled forth to join them, leaning heavily on the arm of Zheni-Simbaya. They sat beside Elanqo.

After an appropriately polite and reverent greeting, Elanqo said, "I have some fermented oacanout leaves for you. Passed on in gratitude by Zheni-Simbaya, who so kindly lent me what I needed today."

The elder squinted out from under the great sagging scaly dome that grew out from their head like the cap of a mushroom.

"What you needed, hm?" Their voice was high and reedy. "What you needed, or what you wanted?"

"I-"

"Leave them be," Zheni-Simbaya nudged Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba gently. "They're working so hard for their sibfriend's germination."

"Nothing to be ashamed of, your wants, you know, little E'lo," Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba continued unperturbed.  "What we want is a function of our environment, as much as our needs are, as much as our capacities and capabilities are. You were designed to fit into the world that existed when you were sown, but the world is always changing, and you with it. Your place is not fixed. Change can be passive, or change can be active."

Almost everyone in the circle had fallen quite, and was listening carefully to Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba's speech.

"You plumules - all of us, but plumules most of all - have an instinct, a natural wisdom that is valuable. Inside, you can sense what you need to become. Listen to your wants - not your needs! That's what tells you. Probe them. See if you can work out where they come from."

Serina and Belline-Tamaa were both nodding although, Elanqo suspected, at different points.

"Make sure they're truly your own wants. Other peoples' needs and wants can creep in. From the networks, all of them. That's right, even from the synctium! But also from the herenow. From your interactions every day. Don't fight this. We are all parts of the same whole in the end. But be aware. Then your instinct can do its best work."

Bishi-Tumalo-Aranthi-Qaba looked around sharply, seeming to meet every eye in the group. Then they nodded, as if to themself, and set to threading the rainbow vines, slowly but accurately.

Elanqo stayed with the group all night. They had thought to go back to the hideaway and make sure the lichen map was still growing right. But something told them they wanted - or perhaps needed - the presence of their sibfriends, the ecosystem of their family, more than they wanted to be alone, in that final time of waiting.

-------

As the sun pushed its first auburn rays over the treetops that made up the horizon, Elanqo squinted in the direction of the vineway. It seemed as though something unusual hovered overhead, following the distant moving foliage, like a flock of birds. Then they felt a familiar tug at the corner of their mind.

"Good morning, little E'lo," said Saba across the overstory. "I'm home."

## Map of the Ages

Waves as tall as ancient trees crashed against the rocks at the base of the tower. Rain lashed against a wild sea, and the wind bellowed and howled as if in pain.

The scale and intensity of it all was lost on Urmra-Calscinthi, who looked out from the very top floor. While they appeared outwardly to be watching the storm, their mind was turned inwards, searching.

This was their twelfth visit to the Broken Coast, and their longest stay in Prolongaria, the settlement surrounding the sky tower, so far. The siblings of the tower were always happy to welcome Urmra-Calscinthi back, but at some point they were going to have to admit that this was a dead end. And yet their research lead them back here, again and again.

"Would you witness the dawn with me?"

A voice from behind pulled Urmra-Calscinthi out of their reverie in the deep net.

"I would be honoured, sibling," they replied dutifully.

Urmra-Calscinthi had been balanced in a crouch on a suspended seat that was little more than a piece of driftwood attached to the ceiling by two bits of tattered old rope. They shuffled their feet out from under them and stepped down to the stone floor. It was cold under bare feet. They stepped into their slippers, which were thin and offered little relief.

The tower sibling who had come up was Abisola-Emena, Urmra-Calscinthi's oldest friend outside of their home den. The put one arm around Urmra-Calscinthi's shoulders and squeezed, sensing their discontent. Urmra-Calscinthi tipped their head into the crook of Abisola-Emena's neck, and sighed.

The two of them walked over to the great micah sheet window that wrapped around the entire circumference of the top floor of the tower. It was supported by eight thick pillars of stone, and inset from the outermost edge, leaving a ledge wide enough to walk around on the outside, for anyone who wanted to overcome a fear of heights the hard way.

Dawn came, with little fanfare. The clouds, deep and textured, forming mountain ranges all of their own, lightened but did not concede to let even a sliver of morning sunlight through.

Urmra-Calscinthi had seen many a spectacular dawn from this window. They knew it was happening; it was just on the other side of the cloudscape. That was enough to bear witness.

They stood shoulder to shoulder in companionable silence for a few moments more.

"Will you leave today?" Asked Abisola-Emena. "I'll be sorry to see you go."

"Yes, and-" Urmra-Calscinthi's voice cracked.

"And this may be your final visit. Ever?"

"I think so," they said sadly.

"Has the time really come to end your travels for good? Well, on this planet I mean. Have you learned all that you need to learn?"

"There is always more to learn," said Urmra-Calscinthi with a small smile. "And certainly an even greater quantity of things I don't know out among the stars than there are here."

They walked together down the long, spiral staircase of the center of the tower.

The sky tower extended deep into the earth, at least as far down as it was tall. Most of the lower levels were abandoned, long since rendered inaccessible by time and the movements of the earth. Half a dozen levels above ground, and the same again below, were home to a fluctuating community of Broken Coasters, mostly Germinated and Flowered, who came seeking knowledge amongst the vast trove of artefacts that had been collected in the higher and lower reaches of the tower over millennia. Some stayed for days, others for their entire midlives.

The tower siblings took care of the artefacts, continually sorting and recording and making what connections they could. Accessing the synctium through an artefact often surfaced a lot more ancient memory about a particular time, place, person or idea, than without. But there was so much; information was buried as fast as it was uncovered. To reside here was to be constantly surrounded by a shifting landscape of discovery, knowledge and myth blurring together, the synctium and the herenow feeding each other in an endless cycle of questions, answers, more questions.

Urmra-Calscinthi had been utterly thrilled by it the first time they came. Even the main den had seemed so sleepy by comparison. The closest you could get there to interrogating ancient mysteries was to connect to the deep net from the thicket of the Old Ones.

But what they needed now were answers, not questions. Certainty and closure, not new avenues to explore.

Urmra-Calscinthi had been searching for an historic map for practically their entire Germinated life. It was at least three thousand years old, and it only made sense that, in all of the world, it would be here in this tower. With everything else that was three thousand years old. And yet they hadn't found it.

As they rounded the spiral on the sixteenth floor, a deafening crack split the air from outside. Urmra-Calscinthi winced. One of the Visitors' shuttles breaking the sound barrier far too close for comfort as it took off back up to their primary habitat in orbit, no doubt. Why they couldn't make their transports run quieter was something Urmra-Calscinthi wondered often, along with everyone else in Nem.

They spent first quarter wandering through the shambling, lopsided community that had grown up around the base of the sky tower over centuries. It was strange to live among stone, and not earth, but their surroundings were far more alive than they appeared at first glance. Opportunistic plants grew out of every available crack and crevice; old stone walls were covered in lichens as hard and crusted as the stone itself. Vines sprang from gutters and draped themselves over terraces and balconies, and sea life washed in, making their homes in any puddle or pool that persisted for longer than a few days. Everything - including the people - was hardened against the salt in the air and harsh crashing winds. It was always wet season here; the only thing that changed was whether it was hot or cold.

Right now it was cold. The rain was coming in fits and starts, a frigid unpredictable spray that seemed to attack from every direction at once. Narrow alleyways among the winding streets offered little protection, and Urmra-Calscinthi rushed through them, sliding on wet cobbles, gathering their hood tight around their head as if the soaked and bedraggled piece of cloth was any help at all.

They toured their old haunts, saying final goodbyes to old friends, and newer ones. The Roundhouse: a kind of miniature amphitheater where people would come together for a shared descent into the synctium, to search out and piece together the many threads of a particular story. Longnights spent there, discussing and debating what they hand all found.

The Gutter: a long straight ditch of a street where newcomers to Prongnia inked, carved, planted, grew their names upon arrival, so the whole length of it was a colourful palimpsest of three-dimensional graffiti.

Hot Room Row: sometimes called the Botannical Quarter; a series of insulated spaces heated by fungal reactions wher plants from the warmer climate of the mainland could thrive through all seasons.

Geodreamers: an enormous complex of crystal caves, reached through a tunnel from the lowest point of settlement, where creative residents gathered to experiment and entertain with light and sound.

Finally, Urmra-Cascinthi passed down a narrow, roughly-hewn stone staircase almost a mirror of the one in the tower except this descended in an s-shape rather than a spiral. It tunnelled through rock, but the cover was patchy; great holes had been worn away in many places. They emerged onto a rocky beach at the precipice of a cliff; the closest you could sensibly get to the sea from the tower. The waves were still some distance below, grasping and clawing up the face of the cliff, furious that they couldn't quite reach the top. On stormier days, the sea would toss rocks and stones over the edge to pile up on this beach, along with any other debris it could dredge up from the sea floor. On its most violent days, the waves would snatch it all back again, too.

Urmra-Calscinthi perused the beach for a few moments, wiping rain water and sea spray from their eyes with the back of an unhelpfully wet hand. They stooped to pick up a small treasure; a glossy turquoise stone that stood out against the grey and brown. They slipped it into a pocket on the side of one leg.

A little way along the beach, beyond a path that was precariously narrow between a sheer rock wall and the heartsopping drop to the raging sea, was the entrance to the Old Ones' Grotto. Not many people chose to take root here. It was a particularly harsh place to do it. Most of those who did were sibings of the sky tower.

The Grotto was a wide, deep cave with a small round opening far above the center. Rain poured through, along with what little grey light had managed to filter through the clouds. Urmra-Calscinthi walked around the edges to avoid the worst of the downpour, but it splattered heavily against the rock floor, sending out a spray in all directions. The walls ran with water too, and went slick with algae and lichen. The rock of the walls were segmented with what looked at first like dark veins, which divided and branched the higher they got. They were tree trunks, the biggest about as thick as Urmra-Calscinthi's wrist. Their roots reached down through cracks in the ground, and some had sprung aerial roots which grasped desperately at rocky nooks and outcrops in the wall. Their tips reached ever higher, straining for the opening the ceiling. None had made it yet. Their lower branches were uniformly bare, but a few had sprung small dark leaves at the higher reaches, which they only just hung onto in the onslaught of the storm.

There were two hundred and twelve Old Ones in total. Urmra-Calscinthi sat in the most sheltered nook they could find, and connected to the synctium.

They immediately felt the presence of about eleven of the Old Ones around them. Some were close, would have been arm to arm, or peering over their shoulder, if they were in the herenow. Others were some distance away, looking off in another direction. Yet others paced restlessly, their thoughts and energy wandering, following focii Urmra-Calscinthi probably would never fathom.

They had come here in the past to commune with the Old Ones, to ask for answers to specific questions. They quickly learnt that to expect such a thing was setup for disappointment. The Old Ones could be talked to, in a sense, and could even help to navigate the synctium, but it took years to learn how to truly reach them, and nobody who had managed it could seem to explain exactly what to do once they were back in the herenow.

Urmra-Calscinthi had found themself on the edge of it, they were sure, but couldn't quite break through. For now, they had just stopped trying, which they thought had a reasonable chance of success.

They relaxed and watched their various meanderings, as far as they could make them out. The longer an Old One was rooted, the more ineffable their activities became. The younger ones were those Urmra-Calscinthi could feel as presences. The elder, they might find if they went looking, but some would be completely out of reach. Unless, of course, whatever mysterious forces compelled them moved one of thtem to come forward.

They were struck, occasionally, with a sadness that they would not root in Nem. They might take root on a distant world, hundreds of years into the future, but in reality they knew not to set their expectations so high. If they were lucky they would awaken on a distant world, and may go to seed depending on the conditions, but in all likelihood would become substrate for a new brytosphere, part of the foundations of their extended society.

The first generation ship, a samara, to leave Nem should be arriving at its destination, soon in relative terms, but not before the one Urmra-Calscinthi was joining was due to depart. Joining one of the multi-century long voyages had seemed the logical next step in their wanderings, although they had expected to have completed their search for the Map before they left. Urmra-Calscinthi practiced all of the techniques they knew to let go of that particular ambition.

Their flowering was near, they sensed that, and not just because of pressure of the increasingly imminent departure of the samara. What discoveries would they report? Nothing material, it seemed.

They would make their way back to the main den in time for that. They needed to be their anyway to begin the preparations for their departure, starting with some 'ductions that would make their body more amenable to deep space 	stasis.

Urmra-Calscinthi had already started to gain weight and lose muscle mass. The wide, flat hexagonal leaves which covered their head and back were starting to swell as new genes taught them to store water; until last year they could only use them to generate energy from the sun. The skin over their whole body had started to thicken and darken too, from their natural deep green to almost black. Their forearms, toes and knees were developing sticky, clinging suckers that would eventually let them scale sheer vertical serfaces as easily as an insect, but for now they were just a nuisance. Urmra-Calscinthi was still on the fence about whether they wanted wings or not.

They reached out into the synctium for memories of people who had gone to the stars before, but they were few. The closest were people who had been to Farne and back. Nobody had found a way to connect to the deep net from off-planet yet, and of course the generation journeys were a long time off sending anyone back to Nem.

Urmra-Calscinthi wondered briefly if the Visitors would add their experiences one day. Probably not any time soon.

Urmra-Calscinthi had been sown as Calscinthi on the day that contact with the lost colony on the moon was reestablished, one hundred and six full years earlier. They felt a connection with the colony because of this, although they had never quite known what to do with that. They had visited once, and found a community trapped in time, with old ideas and new technology, simultaneously advanced and backward in the eyes of a Nem local. They always thought they would return, but never had. It wasn't too late, yet.

Urmra-Calscinthi flitted between memories and records of long journeys, germination discoveries, nomadic lives. Some of the Old Ones joined them in their ramble, silent curious observers adding their own commentary on a level that remained just out of reach to Urmra-Calscinthi's subconscious.

They left some of their own records too, for others to find when they needed them. They had had a more varied Germination than most people did, after all. Urmra-Calscinthi found the process of recording into the synctium somewhat artistic.

They began by reaching around to feel what their canvas would be. This varied depending on where they were in the herenow when they connected, along with the proximity of others (including Old Ones) in the deep net, and their state of mind at the time. Just now, they found something akin to a rocky shore, waves lapping, tide rising. They recorded their past few seasons in the sky tower, documenting their dead ends and realisations, setting the foundations of their inscription deep, building robust walls around it, and anchoring the trail of stories to those Old Ones who were present. Everything they could think of to keep their stored memories stable and clear, and untouched by whatever currents seemed to be threatening. They weaved it in to their own earlier records, building on them or modifying what was there. They buttressed it further using records left by Abisola-Emera, memories they had shared.

Though the message they tried to leave behind was that the Map was not in Prolongnia at all, they couldn't help but leave a trace of doubt at this conclusion.

----

That shortnight, Urmra-Calscinthi departed for the Drowned Isles. They walked across the enormous causeway that joined Prolongnia to the Rock Cordate, the central hub that connected most of the places along the Broken Coast. Abisola-Emena walked with them. The rain was light, dancing and twirling around them, but they were both soaked through again before they were a quarter of the way across. In the distance the lights of the beamer transports glimmered like strings of stars, a trail of fireflies to follow from the Rock to a distant destination of the traveller's choice.

Abisola-Emena stopped at the end of the causeway. By their commitment to the sky tower, they could not step onto another island of the Broken Coast until they flowered. Urmra-Calscinthi stepped back, and they wrapped their arms around each other in a tight hug. They exchanged no more words.

Urmra-Calscinthi stepped over the invisible threshold separating the causeway from the Rock Cordate and walked on, with one final glance back.

They expected to feel tears burning behind their eyes, or an ache in their chest as they walked away, and was almost disappointed to discover neither. This was all the plan, and had been for a long time. There were no regrets, not really. There was only the herenow, and putting one foot in front of the other.

It wasn't long before Urmra-Calscinthi reached a line of beamers, drifting slowly and in no particular direction, and crawled inside of one.

The inside of the pod was soft and warm, and the dim light that had been present increased to a golden glow as Urmra-Calscinthi's energies were taken up by the vehicle. Urmra-Calscinthi wriggled around in the tight space, trying to find a comfortable position. The ride was going to take all of the next day and most of the following longnight, and it was a lot harder to readjust when the beamer was travelling at some speed. They eventually settled on their front, with their cheek resting on folded hands.

The beamer was kind of a microcosm of the samara that would soon be Urmra-Calscinthi's whole world. It worked in concert with whatever nearby entities it was genetically attuned with, and coasted along magnetic fields at speeds far more than those at which a person could run. The beamers along the Broken Coast were simple, travelling only along particular routes and constrained by gravity in ways that the samara was not.

Some people could see through the thick skin of the beamer pod. Urmra-Calscinthi could not, unless they tried particularly hard. In this weather and at night, there wasn't much of a view in any case.

As the beamer charged up, it moved out of its holding drift and into a faster moving convoy of other pods. Urmra-Calscinthi didn't really have to do anything to direct it. The subconscious maneuvering required to convince the pod to take them to the right place was second nature at this point.

The beamer took them at a relatively steady pace across and off the Rock Cordate, and zigzagged its way over a shallow seascape of craggy islets. The area couldn't decide whether it was land or sea, and was next to impossible to navigate either on foot or in a boat, even when there wasn't a storm. The beamers moved together in a line, although Urmra-Calscinthi couldn't tell if any of the others were occupied by people or not. The beamers frequently rearranged themselves along the transport lanes to keep the necessary balance in both their own network, and across the wide net.

Lulled by the swaying motion of the journey, Urmra-Calscinthi relaxed and slipped into the brytosphere.

They found themself walking on clouds, smooth and flowing underfoot, quite unlike the angry storm clouds that were scrawled across the sky in the herenow. Everything was a grey blue, lit from nowhere and everywhere at once, with no distinction to mark out a horizon at all. It was as if they walked around the inside of a great sphere, endlessly turning. A small white light darted about up ahead, its jerking movements quite at odds with the creamy softeness of the rest of the surroundings. Urmra-Calscinthi followed the firefly automatically, although any change in direction was barely noticeable.

Urmra-Calscinthi's whole body was soon covered in a rolling layer of mist that poured up in streamers like a waterfall in reverse. There was a lot to heal as the results of Urmra-Calscinthi's most recent 'ductions integrated with their DNA. Some adaptations happened as expected, and some struggled to be made sense of. Urmra-Calscinthi had never had to have a 'duction reversed; even the ones that didn't work out as planned usually settled into some kind of stability with the help of the brytosphere.

The changes needed for life on the samara would make it harder and harder to exist comfortably on Nem. The way things were going, it seemed likely that their final 'ductions would have to take place on Farne, and they would at last join the samara from there. Not everyone needed to do things that way, but most did. Urmra-Calscinthi had hoped to be an exception.

The beamer progressed along its route, slowing down or speeding up occasionally, over the course of the rest of the longnight and most of the next day. When they weren't in the brytosphere, Urmra-Calscinthi spent their time sorting through the connections and discoveries they had made in the sky tower, and contacting people or catching up on events further afield over the high net.

The Drowned Isles were the furthest part of the Broken Coast from the mainland. The beamer began to climb, the pod tipping from its more or less horizontal orientation to almost vertical, as it made its way up and over the great crescent shaped reef that marked the edge of the cluster of small island communities. A short while later it began a longer, shallower ascent to the highest point in the center of the Isles, the peak of an obelisk on the summit of a mountain known as Dry Point.

The glowing line of beamers, their light less prominent in the daytime, but still visible from miles around through the overcast gloom, took turns to one by one circle the apex of the obelisk, very slowly. Once each had done two full loops, they descended from the opposite side to which they had arrived, creating an image of a pyramid of lights.

Dry Point mountain, along with several other of the Drowned peaks, was still raised comfortably high above the sea level, even with a storm churning at the waters. But the sea level was rising by the day, and the island residents had long since begun their preparations for the high tide.

When it was time for the beamer which had transported Urmra-Calscinthi to circle the obelisk, Urmra-Calscinthi felt it slow. The interior contracted a little in a gentle message to indicate they had a chance to disembark if they wanted to take it. Urmra-Calscinthi always imagined this as a goodbye hug.

They pushed one hand against he side of the pod and a seam appeared, where none had been visible before. The pod opened along the line and Urmra-Calscinthi squeezed their head and shoulders out of the narrow but flexible slit.

The Dry Point obelisk was in some ways like a miniature version of the sky tower, although not as old or elaborate.

Just below its pyramidal top, a platform jutted out providing a wide balcony onto which Urmra-Calscinthi stepped from the beamer, which had almost stopped moving altogether once they had opened the side. As soon as Urmra-Calscinthi's foot was clear, the beamer sped off again, completing its circuit and then beginning its descent.

Urmra-Calscinthi stretched, wriggled their limbs, and took several deep breaths of cold salty air. It wasn't raining, and the spray from the sea had no chance of reaching them up here. But for the wind, it was almost pleasant.

They walked along the balcony towards an open arched doorway. They looked back for a few moments, but it didn't look like anyone was getting out of any of the circling beamers that had arrived behind.

Through the doorway was a plain, empty room. The walls were dark and smooth, and the only source of light was the entrance through which Urmra-Calscinthi had come. As they approached the center of the floor, the walls appeared to turn about them. It would have been dizzying if they weren't so used to it. It was the floor that was moving, not the walls, in a slow rotation as it descended through the middle of the obelisk.

From the outside, the obelisk was a little over twice as high as a person, and its main purpose was to adjust the height of the mountain so that there would always be a point above sea level even during the fullest tides. But the hollow shaft for the elevator it housed passed right through the core of the mountain and into the heart of the underground part of the Drowned Isles community.

Two older plumules were waiting to greet Urmra-Calscinthi when the elevator platform stopped. Urmra-Calscinthi saw them from above and grinned. The platform emerged through a circular hole in the ceiling of a wide open space, the enormous cave called the Dome, which served as the central gathering and social space in Dry Point mountain. From that point, its sides were open and it descended, still rotating slowly, with a spectacular view across a bustling hive of activity.

Rising tide was always the best time to visit, Urmra-Calscinthi thought. There was an excitement in the air and everyone was busy with something; it was sort of festive. At low tide, life took place on the surface, on mountainsides, in valleys, and forests and fields. It was pleasant enough, especially in warm weather, but the place could easily pass for a perfectly normal rural community. High tide had a different character altogether. The place became tranquil, resting. Life continued at a slower pace, access to the overstory was limited, supplies were carefully metered out, and the place began to feel insular, as if it was the only place in the world. Nobody could root or go to seed in that time, germinations had to wait, and flowerings were rare. It was a similar kind of stasis as that Urmra-Calscinthi had to look forward to aboard the samara.

This high tide would not last too long, two seasons at most would pass on the surface before the sea began to recede. Some lasted for years. Calculating the tides was a particular expertise that Urmra-Calscinthi did not have. It was complicated: involving the  relative orbits of Rannouckouch and Nem, as well as accounting for the influence of Farne.

In any case, they were glad to have the opportunity to visit again before the entrances were all cut off.

Cali and Tilindi were vibrating with excitement when Urmra-Calscinthi stepped off the platform to greet them. They squeaked their welcomes and grabbed one of Urmra-Calscinthi's hands each, pulling them along behind. In the background, the platform rotated one final time, made a soft click, and then reversed direction and began to rise back up.

All around were sounds of talking and laughter, clanking and tinkling and rustling as people made, mended, packed and stored things. Young plumules chased each other around, shrieking with delight, watched over from a distance by elder Flowered or fading Seeded.

"It's finished, it's finished!" Cali was breathless.

"You made it just in time!" Tilindi, usually a little less excitable, was infected with Cali's enthusiasm.

Last time Urmra-Calscinthi had been here, the pair had been bursting with agitation that they had been working on "a project" for Urmra Calscinthi, but had promised each other not to tell what it was until it was finished. Urmra-Calscinthi had known them both since they were sown, and had attracted their particular interest when they had visited to teach a group of Germinated about coaxing plants to grow in certain formations or with specific characteristics by subtle changes to the environment around them without needing any alterations to genetic material. This had plenty of practical day-to-day applications of course, but what had captivated the pair of plumules was that the techniques could be used purely for entertainment value as well: they could use it to make art.

The duo led Urmra-Calscinthi down a side passage and out of the Dome. Urmra-Calscinthi had been glancing around, looking for familiar faces, those they had contacted over the overstory to let them know of their impending arrival, but spotted no-one they knew well.

They discovered why when Cali and Tilindi directed them to enter a room ahead of them. The entrance was hung with delicately flowered vines, obscuring whatever it was within, but Urmra-Calscinthi could hear voices.

The lifted the vines aside gently and stepped through to cheers and laughter.

"It's our grand opening!" Said Cali behind them.

"Welcome to our gallery!" Giggled Tilindi.

"Good to see you, my sibfriend," said a low husky voice to Urmra-Calscinthi's left.

They turned into the tight embrace of Djenna-Maswe, a companion from their plumulehood, whom they had been sown alongside. "Wow, you really are changing."

Before Urmra-Calscinthi could catch up with the Germinated, they dutifully followed Cali and Tilindi in a tour of the space. It was actually very impressive. They had lined the walls with large angled containers, each packed with carefully adjusted nutrient mixes, illuminated by stored light at precise frequencies, drip fed with water _just so_, inoculated with fungal spores, carefully temperature controlled, and so on. They had even done something with radio waves in some cases. There were twelve displays, representing the twelve star systems Urmra-Calscinthi's samara would pass in sight of on their voyage. Each was a floral or fungal or leafy interpretation of the names and known characteristics of each system, and some of them were truly stunning.

"I don't remember having an imagination as good as this when I was a plumule," Urmra-Calscinthi murmured to Djenna-Maswe as Cali and Tilindi took turns to introduce each exhibit. Each one also came with a poem or tune or emotive recitation of a profound quite from the past.

After oohing and ahhing at the exhibits, and sampling an array of snacks carried enthusiastically around by Cali and Tilindi's younger sibfriends (all of which were apparently brand new recipes concocted by the endlessly creative pair) Urmra-Calscinthi finally had time to talk to the people they would really miss when they left Nem.

Four of them sat in a circle in the now-empty 'gallery' space. The only light came from some of the artwork on the walls and the slight glow of Djenna-Maswe's golden-yellow skin where it wasn't covered by clothes.

They held hands lightly, except for Ambrim-Qaba who only had spindly branching twig-like appendages to offer. Yuno-Bimhai sat in a self-generated pool of water, that was slowly spreading as their pores exuded more fluid.

"I hope you're going to get that looked at," Djenna-Maswe joked.

"It wouldn't be the Drowned Isles without Yuno-Bimhai to drown us all," creaked Ambrim-Qaba.

"Work in progress," muttered Yuno-Bimhai with much more of a gurgle than they intended. Urmra-Calscinthi laughed.

"What a place for us all to end up."

The four sibfriends had all been sown as part of a small settlement on the outskirts of the main den. After germination, their lives had all taken very different paths, and they rarely found themselves together in one place.

Djenna-Maswe had moved permanently to Dry Point mountain, or at least as permanently as anything could be. They expected to root here. They had been instrumental in upgrading the islands sea defenses over the past few years, and now was overseeing spin-off projects to carry out the same improvements on the neighbouring islands.

Ambrim-Qaba had been composing an epic poem for several years. They usually spent their time in total stillness n the depths of the most remote forests they could find, observing the living things which reside in such places. They had been stationary on one of the smaller uninhabited Drowned Isles for a couple of seasons, then moved to Dry Point when the rising tide was about to submerge their woodland. They would make their way back to the mainland before Dry Point became inaccessible as well.

Yuno-Bimhai had been in the foothills of the eastern mountains for most of the time since they germinated. They had most recently been monitoring weather conditions and advising people on the adaptations needed as conditions changed. They had traveled to Dry Point especially for this reunion, and their presence was a surprise for Urmra-Calscinthi. The other surprise was their body's reaction to the coastal climate after they had, apparently, overspecialised for the arid eastern heights.

They sat together for the rest of the day and throughout the shortnight that followed. Their talk was interspersed between exchanges with other distant friends on the overstory, and sharing and embedding memories and discoveries in the synctium. They passed smoothly between networks and the herenow, drifting with each other to wherever their attention lead.

"There's a kind of millipede that can access the brytosphere directly in Western Sun Hao," Ambrim-Qaba told them.

"No way! Does that make it a Person?"

"I don't think it does it on purpose. It drifts in and out, crossing the boundary as it would skirt around a branch in its path."

"A branch? How big is this thing?"

Ambrim-Qaba shared an image from their experience.

"Something is accelerating a temperature rise in the east. It's been more extreme this hot season than ever before."

"Is the network out of balance?"

"It doesn't seem to be. It's like the heat is to keep the balance, so a condition must have changed somewhere else. I'm hoping my team can get to the bottom of it before next hot season."

"You have a team! That's so great. Is it like being in many places at once?"

"I wish. It's more  like having a bunch of plumules to take care of..."

"The impression you left on the little ones here was enormous, Urmra-Calscinthi. They'll be milking this for inspiration for years to come. You might have instigated a whole culture change. They have not shut up about the 'project' for two seasons, and there are copycats springing up all over the place."

"Honestly, I don't know where plumules get their energy."

"Maybe they're what's causing the network to go out of balance!"

None of them mentioned Urmra-Calscinthi's imminent flowering and departure. They were waiting for Urmra-Calscinthi to bring it up themself. But Urmra-Calscinthi was enjoying too much listening to the others to change the subject.

"Did you hear that the Visitors have built an outpost over the Harshness?"

"Right by the main den!"

"They built an entire _island_ out to the north from here."

"How are they handling the storms? Has anyone told them about the tides?"

"I expect someone has, but I think they came prepared for much worse conditions than we actually have."

"Three of them came here to see our defenses last year. I don't think they were impressed."

"Really? What are they like?"

Djenna-Maswe shared a collection of images, feelings and sensations. "Different."

_Not that different,_ thought Urmra-Calscinthi, feeling for the first time an uncanny kinship with these creatures from the stars.

------

After several days of connection, celebration, teaching, learning and mucking in with the Dry Point day-to-day, the time came for Urmra-Calscinthi to depart. Ambrim-Qaba had left almost at once after their reunion, but Yuno-Bimhai stayed a little longer. Urmra-Calscinthi decided to accompany them back to the eastern mountains.

They left the Dry Point by beamer, taking one pod each out in the direction that led towards the next easternmost island. It was almost completely underwater, with just enough space to stop for a picnic on the little round hummock that remained, if the weather had been good enough. The beamer route ended here, then looped back on itself, toured the rest of the inhabited Drowned Isles, then went back to the Rock Cordate.

Urmra-Calscinthi and Yuno-Bimhai were met by a grizzled Flowered in a slimy looking purple boat who had replied to their request for transport over the high net. Their name was Pana-Leiha-Emtu, and their boat was a living giant rhodophyta which extended for miles up from the sea floor and formed a cradle with its fronds which was - or could become - big enough for the three of them to ride in comfortably. Pana-Leiha-Emta was continuously engaged in a complex dance with the brytosphere, negotiating long chains of resource exchange to persuade the rhodophyta to veer in a particular direction. It was how the vineways around the main den worked, but Urmra-Calscinthi had never seen such a system controlled by one person before.

Pana-Leiha-Emta delivered them safely to the shore of the mainland, at last.

They spent half a day trudging through swamps before they saw the next sign of people. Although it turned out they had been being watched for a while. They paused to rest beside a short but wide tree with steep arching roots that were just big and strong enough to perch on for seats. Branches fanned out and over above them, but were devoid of leaves. Smooth tendrils as thick of a finger and inexplicably heavy draped down from the heights of the branches like a shroud.

Yuno-Bimhai couldn't tell if their pores were still leaking because they were pretty well covered in wet mud from the surroundings. They both were. The ground began to bubble all around them, and creatures draped with rushes and reeds began to rise up, some pulling themselves from the sucking mud using the cables that hung from the tree. They formed a semicircle around Urmra-Calscinthi and Yuno-Bimhai, who backed unconsciously into the trunk of the tree. Urmra-Calscinthi slipped hastily into the synctium and confirmed what they suspected: that these were most likely people from the insular Breesh Mar community, which stewarded this land.

"About time," muttered Yuno-Bimhai.

"Travellers," said one of the figures. They all looked like small mounds of plant life, with no features or limbs distinguishable at all.

"What brings you through Breesh Mar?" Said another.

"On our way to the eastern mountains," replied Yuno-Bimhai. "From the Drowned Isles. Don't pretend people don't come this way ll the time. Is Ilsha-Sleem around?"

"Yu-Bi!" One of the mounds on the end of the row slurred. "So it is you! Couldn't recognise you behind all that water."

Yuno-Bimhai laughed and gave Urmra-Calscinthi a look that said not to question them. "Perhaps you could escort us to solid ground?"

"It would be our pleasure," said a different mound. It seemed to Urmra-Calscinthi that they all more or less spoke with the same voice, except for the one identified as Ilsha-Sleme.

They departed in a line, each mound seeming to rise and sink slightly as they moved forward through the swamp. The mud reached Urmra-Calscinthi's knees, and they were splattered at least as high as their waist. Their cloak was soaked and heavy with the stuff. Yuno-Bimhai had assured them that they had taken this route many times before, that it was the most efficient way, but Urmra-Calscinthi was starting to have doubts. They seemed to be walking perpendicular to the directon Urmra-Calscinthi thought they ought to be going. They tried to ping Yuno-Bimhai on the overstory, but they ignored them. The mud seemed to be getting thicker and heavier too, and Urmra-Calscinthi felt themself slowing down. Yuno-Bimhai was somehow able to keep pace with their guides.

"Wait," Urmra-Calscinthi gasped eventually, stumbling in the tangle of plants that lived thickly in the muddy water.

Yuno-Bimhai dropped back but kept one eye looking ahead as they hooked Urmra-Calscinthi's arm in their own.

"We're nearly there, just keep taking steps. Lift your feet higher. They'll just leave us if we lose them."

"Who _are_ these people?"

"And don't send anything on the overstory, they can monitor local high net traffic easier than listening in the herenow. They're not always doing it, but you can never tell when they are. Or, I can't at least. Yes, even person to person messages."

Urmra-Calscinthi would have stopped to gawk if they weren't so busy putting one foot in front of the other, dragging at Yuno-Bimhai's arm as they did so. Yuno-Bimhai seemed to practically float across the surface of the marsh.

All at once they were in a kind of clearing. The mud ended and Urmra-Calscinthi finally stepped onto something resembling dry land. Well, it was still mud, but more of a hard, sticky kind than the knee deep liquid they had been trudging through moments before. The Breesh Mar people were suddenly taller now they weren't partially submerged, and Urmra-Calscinthi could see large webbed feet poking out from the slimy drooping weeds they all seemed to be covered with from head to foot. There was a hint of shoulders now they had slowed down enough to look properly, but still no distinct limbs or faces. One was a little taller than the others, and when they spoke Urmra-Calscinthi recognised the voice of Ilsha-Sleme.

"We have arrived," they said, "on solid ground."

Urmra-Calscinthi looked about, finally releasing their grip on Yuno-Bimhai's arm. They appeared to be on a kind of island in a swamp, a raised patch of ground surrounded by the dark water which swirled with mud and aquatic plants. Gnarled trees with fat trunks and graspy, loopy roots were dotted here and there; verdant bushes with wide flat leaves almost the size of a person filled the gaps between. Urmra-Calscinthi couldn't see where they could possibly go from here.

"Perfect," said Yuno-Bimhai, looking up at the sky. "You have my enduring thanks. As always." They turned from Ilsa-Sleme to address the others. "Might I know your name?"

"We are," said one.

"Elebele," said another.

"It's a god job we were here," a third.

"Or you might have been..."

"...wandering in circles..."

"...for some time!"

Urmra-Calscinthi was surprised They were tall for plumules, but their voices did carry a certain immaturity. And they _were_ all the same. Now Urmra-Calscinthi looked more closely they realised all eight seemed to be visually identical as well. While the leaves and slime were tussled and draped differently, they all had basically the same makeup; a thick dark green strand here, a cluster of fuzzy brown there.

"Ahoy!" A voice called from above, making Urmra-Calscinthi almost jump out of their skin.

"We leave you now in the hands of your friend. Your excessive waters unbalance our land. Make haste and good luck in your journey to your mountains." With that, Ilsha-Sleme stepped off the edge of the solid patch and promptly disappeared completely into the water at the side. One by one, Elebele followed, evenly spaced plops marking their exit.

Yuno-Bimhai was waving up at what appeared to be a giant shell lowering itself down toward them.

This was a much more familiar sight to Urmra-Calscinthi than what they had just witnessed. They moved out of the way and reached up to help land the air-rider by pulling on the guide ropes that hung down from the shell.

Urmra-Calscinthi knew several people who refused to travel in air-riders; the risk that the creature - part plant, part animal - would just drop the basket was not negligible. But guide pilots were so by midlife vocation and trained for years to achieve harmony with the nomadic beings. Urmra-Calscinthi had known guide pilots themself and had confidence in their skill and dedication to keep everyone in the air. Many were genetically bonded to a particular air-rider, so they could effectively move as one.

"Urma-Calscinthi, this is Bo/Ela-Planqo," Yuno-Bimhai said as they helped the guide pilot down from the shell. They were a slight figure with a pale face and limbs, drowning in thick clothes and a large cosy looking hat with ear flaps.

"I think we've met," said Urmra-Calscinthi with a smile. "In the higher reachers many seasons ago."

"Yes, I remember you," Bo/Ela-Planqo's voice was low and soft. "I was just Ela-Planqo then."

They all boarded and were soon airborne, with Bo/Ela-Planqo inflating and deflating their huge hydrogen-filled balloon-like sacks that drifted above them on pale swaying stalks, the two beings working in concert to sense and react to the currents in the air.

The smooth curved basket which held them was comfortably filled with cushions and blankets. The air-rider curled its roots underneath to carry it along. The factors which made the roots unclench once they had sent in place were not well understood.

Urmra-Calscinthi nestled against an edge, wrapping a blanket around their shoulders as the cool air chilled them through their swamp-damp clothes. They peered over the side, resting their chin on their hands and watched the marsh get smaller and smaller. From up here, the rivulets that formed the marsh made beautiful swirling patterns of grey-blue amongst the green as they snaked their way across the land and back towards the sea. An map of this would make a lovely decorative image, Urmra-Calscinthi thought. Soon the view dissolved in a haze of white as they passed into the clouds.

"So the Breesh Marh people down there," Urmra-Calscinthi whispered to Yuno-Bimhai. "Where they all from the same Propagated?"

"Yeah, they do it a bit differently there," Yuno-Bimhai spoke at a normal volume. "They can pretty much propagate indefinitely. They very rarely have any Seeded. I spent time in the Breesh Mar Lakeden a few seasons ago. It's pretty weird. Ilsha-Sleme is one of eleven Slemes, and I couldn't tell them apart by looking. They're all different once they germinate of course, but they rarely do any gene transfers so a lot of them remain identical through midlife as well. It doesn't help that most of them keep their faces covered."

"Is that part of their bodies, or something growing over them?"

Yuno-BImhai shrugged. "it's a mix, I think."

"Sometimes hard to tell where the people end and the marsh begins," put in Bo/Ela-Planqo with a grin.

It wasn't long before the clouds parted and an entirely new landscape revealed itself. The winds seemed calmer, and Urmra-Calscinthi had dried off. Yuno-Bimhai had not.

Instead of lush green marshes, they looked down over a dry scrubland, dotted with cacti and tufty brown and yellow brush.

The land undulated with hills that became more and more severe, until in the distance they could make out the sharp rise of the foothills of the eastern mountains. The landscape was made all the more dramatic by long shadows cast by the setting sun, visible at last. The sky took on a warm orange cast, and the clouds that did dot the sky had edges flushed with reds and pinks.

It was night by the time they landed in the foothills, though the western horizon still held an orange gleam. Urmra-Calscinthi glanced self-consciously at the stars which appeared and disappeared as clouds drifted past. Rannoukouch twinkled bringly, competing with Farne for attention in the sky.

Bo/Ela-Planqo dropped them off and said goodbye, ascending again immediately for their next pickup or rescue.

"Are you still melting?" Urmra-Calscinthi asked as the two of them walked across the dry gravelly terrain.

"I think it's getting better actually," said Yuno-Bimhai. "I'm still damper than I should be thought."

The final remnants of sunlight were washed into an inky blacknes. They followed a well-used trail towards the settlement of Nshimava, where Yuno-Bimhai had been living for the past three seasons. Urmra-Calscinthi had never been here before.

The foothills of the eastern mountains were characterised by the remains of an ancient forest, long since petrified. The ground was scattered with rocky stumps, anywhere from ankle high 'trippers' to pillars the height of an average Germinated. In Nshimava these were seamlessly a part of every day life, things to lean on, or put things on, or hang things from. Nshimava itself was bordered by a ring of much larger fossilised stumps, the widest of which it could take as much as a while quarter to walk a circle around. The highest, called Aligashu, loomed like a coastal cliffside and obscured the view of the mountain range beyond. This marked the center of the settlement, and the ancient forest, and Nshimava itself, stretched out for miles on either side.

The area they walked through was quiet. Younger plumules would be sleeping, but there were normally more people around in the early night; Yuno-Bimhai was puzzled.

"Look, over there," Urmra-Calscinthi pointed to some hovering lights int he distance which had been obscured by a petrified trunk a moment before. The pair headed over.

A crowd of Germinated had gathered and were discussing something in urgent tones. Yuno-Bimhai tapped one of them lightly on the shoulder on the outskirts of the group.

"Oh hey, you're back," they acknowledged them briefly then turned back to the conversation in the center.

"What's going on?|

"Oh, some of the Visitors are on their way. You know, it's starting to look like- oh hello, I'm Cosha-Mitsi," they nodded at Urmra-Calscinthi, who spoke their name in return. "I don't think they're just' visiting', you know? I don't think they ever were... Why are you so wet?"

"I don't think there's a question of that," interjected a broad hairy person to their left, gruffly. "Given the scale of the things they've been building."

"I thought the stuff they were putting up was temporary..."

"What exactly is the crisis for us right now?"

"Shh, Tempa-Ilindari-Sanoya is speaking..."

Urmra-Calscinthi couldn't hear properly even without the muttering around them, the middle of the group was too far away. They tapped into the high net in passive mode and caught the gist of the situation from the local traffic.

A relatively large cohort of Visitors were on their way by land, about two days distant. Normally the Visitors travelled in groups of three or four, so to hear of the approach of two dozen had alarmed some of the Flowered. It seemed to be some kind of pilgrimage, though to what end nobody could imagine. They typically also travelled by air, so their slow route was another strangeness. The people of Nem had just got used to the Visitors' presence, so for them to suddenly start exhibiting new patterns of behaviour was a source of much speculation. Nonetheless, the residents of Nshimava were determined to welcome their strange guests as best they could. The scramble was primarily about figuring out how to accommodate them.

"They live always inside structures," said Urmra-Calscinthi in awe as the gathering dispersed and they, Yuno-Bimhai, and a couple of others walked away. "And always sleep at night. Every night, inside! I never realised."

"It's going to be a challenge to find somewhere to put them at short notice."

"It sounds like they tent idea with cloth and pillars will work well."

"Can you believe they can't adjust their own body temperature?"

"I don't believe it, I think that's a rumour. They would always be too warm or too cold. There are too many changes in the environment-"

"Maybe they come from somewhere where the temperature is always the same?"

"There's really nothing we can do about it. Any idea what is normal for them?"

There were universal shrugs.

"Maybe they just take clothes to an extreme? Like when we go to a place we're not adapted for?"

"You're soggy, yuck, what's going on?"

Yuno-Bimhai sighed. They weren't as wet as they had been in the Drowned Isles, but a thin layer of moisture still covered their skin.

Yuno-Bimhai turned to Urmra-Calscinthi. "So are you going to stick around to meet them?"

"Tempting... But I think I have to keep moving."

It was sort of the truth. Urmra-Calscinthi was as naturally curious about the Visitors as everyone else seemed to be, but at the same time recoiled at the thought of meeting them face to face. It was quite foolish really. They couldn't avoid them forever and surely there was much to learn from them about travel between the stars> They had come on a generation ship after all. Those who had arrived on Nem had been sown in space. No-one could know it better.

Now wasn't the time, but Urmra-Calscinthi quietly resolved to seek some of them out when they got to the main den.

"I want to get to Lullamall in time for the networks festival. Will you come?"

Yuno-Bimhai shook their head. "I think I'm going to be needed here."

---

Lullamall was a two day climb into the mountains, or a shortnight's ride on the trellis wheel. Normally, the motion of the trellis wheel made Urmra-Calscinthi feel sick enough to spend the time and energy walking, but they didn't have that luxury on this occasion. They had asked around after air-riders, but none were planning to pass near by for several days.

The trellis wheel comprised small pods, suspended stomach-churningly from an enormous length of cable that led up and over the nearest mountain, down the other side, and three quarters of the way up the next one. The whole thing was kept in motion by a series of wheels turned by the water of falls high up in the mountains. As far as anyone knew, it had been running continuously for nearly three thousand years. The swinging compartments had changed over time, become more comfortable, safer, made from lighter materials, but the bulk of the structure was generations old.

Urmra-Calscinthi retreated to the brytosphere for the duration of the journey, missing the views across the mountains, which from here looked like gigantic version of the petrified stumps of Nshimava. Their steep sides flowed, rounded and sweeping towards the earth in segments like the base of the stumps did before they split into roots and vanished underground.

They arrived at dawn, the sun hidden behind the mountains of Marcin's Carn, but painting everything inland in a cheerful yellow light. This time nobody met Urmra-Calscinthi on the trellis wheel platform, and they walked alone along the sparsely wooded track that led to the saddle which was home to Lullamall.

The place wa smuch as they remembered it. Like Nshimava, there were no structures which marked out the area as somewhere people resided. Sporadic groups of people were visible, sitting or walking, talking or doing things, and the paraphernalia of everyday life lay about. Urmra-Calscinthi had studied the patterns of the _stuff_ in Lullamall once, and then started subtly moving things around to create new patterns, either visual ones or leaving messages of meaning in the arrangements of objects. You could get away with that sort of thing in Lullamall; they had a culture and appreciation of more obscure forms of art that went back millennia.

There were shallow caves at the highest point above the saddle. They were at the base of a steep and challenging climb that led ultimately to the summit of Marcin's Carn. No trees grew beyond them. Urmra-Calscinthi hiked up there. They greeted a few people on the way, who all seemed happy to see Urmra-Calscinthi back, but were busy with something else. Urmra-Calscinthi knew they would have a chance to reconnect properly with old friends at the first quarter Germinated gathering.

The caves were used for storage. Urmra-Calscinthi walked past walls lined with containers made from empty oacanout shells stacked with cloth and fastenings for clothes, through barrels of leaves fermenting or pickling; around buckets of inks and paint; beneath the hanging bulbs which held seeds in suspension in case they were needed.

Years before, they had requisitioned a small corner for safe storage of the maps they had been gathering, or making.

They reached back into a pouch on the inside of their cloak and pulled out a small flat stone, about the size of their palm. On it, in intricate fine detail, a pattern had been etched. It looked a lot, to Urmra-Calscinthi's practiced eye, like a map, though not of any place they recognised. They had no success in tracing its origin in the sky tower where they found it, but the stone itself seemed to be the same kind of shale found widely in the upper reaches of the eastern mountains. Later, they could try connecting to the synctium through the object from here, a place that might be closer to its roots. It wasn't The Map of course, but it was a fascinating mystery to uncover nonetheless. They placed it in a nook besides the collection of scrolls and painted leaves and etched bark and various other creative ways people had translated their interpretations of the herenow onto materials over the centuries.

* * *

The networks festival was celebrated all over Nem. Every community had their own interpretation of it, and nowhere did it quite like Lullamall. The people there had stripped the ceremony down to its barest essentials, never forgetting that it was a ritual with a purpose. The energy they brought to it somehow continued to make it both a functional and beautiful occasion.

* * *

Urmra-Calscinthi went from being one of many to a part of a whole. The transition was more like remembering than becoming. It was a return to the true and proper state of being. The energy of the networks and of every living thing connected with them flowed freely through and around them, and they flowed with it. This was the only time they could experience all three networks at once; when they let go of themself and saw through the minds of others. When they _became_ the network.

Their awareness was so dispersed and fragmented that they didn't realise when they became a triply connecting node, a nexus between the high, wide and deep nets.

The overstory stretched out above, a sea of faces peering down, eyes wide, minds open, patiently awaiting, listening for knowledge, primed for connection, and projecting the sensations of their bodies. Here was where the line between the networks and the herenow was the thinnest; a membrane through which information flooded.

The brytosphere surrounded them, endless boundless space where the balance was kept. A swirling, humming, constant thriving, a continuous chain of reactions and interactions, nudging and compensating, weighing up, shifting, realigning, preempting, filling in, smoothing out.

The synctium was beneath them, a foundation; a root system that reached through the ages. Connection across time, the dense, entangled un-navigable ancestral memory of Nem.

Urmra Calscinthi was back in their body, aware of their own mind, but no longer a spectator flowing with the currents of the collective. They were a participant, active, a being with a role to play and doing so came as naturally as breathing. They were enormous, as big as the world, with their feet in the synctium, entrenched and grounded. Their arms held wide, encircling Nem and everything in it. Their head in the overstory, seeing, hearing, tasting; knowing all that happened, all at once. If they had voice they would have gasped at the sense it all made.

The brytosphere was fed by the herenow and the synctium simultanously. The overstory provided the bridge, and the brytosphere took the present of the herenow and the past of the synctium and used them to do its work of generating the future. Urmra-Calscinthi saw every link, every connection in the web of cause and effect that had ever been, the web of needs that encompassed - no that _was_ - the world, and the delicate threads of change that kept the equilibrium.

The feeling lasted a moment, but it as a moment the length of a lifetime.

And there was something else in that moment. A voice. A whisper, tiny against the backdrop of eternity. Urmra-Calscinthi didn't so much as hear it, but felt it like a tremor in their nerve endings.

And then Urmra-Calscinthi flowered.

The voice was the mapmaker, and it confirmed everything Urmra-Calscinthi had just discovered. And then it welcomed them to the next part of their life.

The moment, which had been the merest fraction of time in the herenow, and indefinite aeons in the networks, came to an end, and Urmra-Calscinthi dissolved back into the gliding multitudes.

-------

"Flowering _during_ the networks festival."

"In the middle of it all!"

"I can't believe it."

"So dramatic."

"I don't know the the last time that's happened, I'd have to look back in the deep net."

"Maybe it's a first."

"No I heard a story, a legend maybe, that it happened before..."

"That was a germination, not a flowering..."

"Wasn't it both at once?"

"That seems unlikely, two stories muddled."

_It was both,_ thought the newly Flowered one, though how they could be sure of that they couldn't quite place. They sat in silence, letting the chatter of their companions wash over them.

They had decisions to make now, though they were in no mood to make them. Would they have their flowering celebration in Lullamall, or return to the main den? They didn't feel like celebrating. It wasn't mandatory to have one, but everyone expected it. A formal declaration of their Flowered name and discoveries. The public closing of one door and opening of the next.

And they couldn't decide if their question, such that it was, was over or not. They had never expected to feel uncertainty about this. On one hand, they had met the mapmaker. The details of that moment when they were the nexus were a blur, too big to hold onto, but a profound sense of confidence in the workings of the universe had settled in them that they knew had not been there before. Yet they did not have the Map. They had more of an idea of what it represented - that it was a blueprint, the layout of the networks and their composition of part of the herenow - but it floated as an idea, a vague sense, and Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi wanted a solid thing. Something they could look over and reflect on, and point at in explanation to other people.

"Excuse me," they stood up abruptly and walked away from the group.

They found themself drifting down the hillside, towards the edge of an old growth forest. It was dense, and dark between the trees, but Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi navigated the undergrowth as if they knew every clutch of fallen branches, every tangle of roots, with fluent grace. They walked for some time.

They turned their mind outwards and noted the scents of the woodland, the sounds of twigs crunching underfoot and birds fluttering overhead. They brushed lightly by a large round bracket growing from the side of a tree and a cloud of spores puffed out. They stopped to marvel at them as they drifted, glimmering bronze in the light that filtered through the canopy, painting the air currents to reveal what had been invisible a moment before. Eerie creaking noises came from distant high places; tall trees finding their balance in a collaboration with the wind. A burrowing creature burst forth, kicked up leaves, vanished again with a flourish, startled by the unexpected footfall. Brambles snagged on their cloak, teasing forth loops of material and interrupting their passage with stuttering pops as they tugged the garment free. Branches and leaves hung low, stroking their arms and torso with cool gentle resistance as they pushed through. Small orange mushrooms practically glowed out from the ever-thickening dark brown leaf litter underfoot. The temperature had dropped; the ground was wetter. Strands of cobweb broke in their face, making them splutter and rub at their eyes, feeling the tickling remnants on their cheeks but not quite able to remove them.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had walked all the way down the mountainside, and was in the valley between Marcin's Carn and Morsefar. Here were the Rooted of the eastern mountains; the Old Ones.

There was no grove or grotto or thicket where people came together to take root here. They were scattered throughout the forest along the valley floor, indistinguishable from ordinary trees.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi barely touched the surface of the synctium before they felt them all around, far more all at once than they had ever felt before. They stopped where the presences, like ghosts, were most pressing, leaned against a tree with gnarled, crumbling bark, and committed themself to the connection with the deep net.

They began to set out their recent memories; it was like planting a row of seeds in a freshly furrowed drill, gently placing them in line one by one. The Old Ones crowded and pushed around, hissing in muffled whispers, until a single voice finally reached Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's awareness.

"Young One, you spoke to the mapmaker?" The voice, or the sense of it, tinkled like a bell, twinkled like the stars, bubbled with music.

"I think... the mapmaker spoke to me, at least."

"Fortuitous timing, your Flowering at the nexus of the networks, and you of all people who have been seeking the mapmaker for so long! But the world knows what it needs, and knows how to make it so."

"Who are you?"

The Old One giggled, or did something that made Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi feel that they did. The exchange was not happening in words, but sensations and ideas. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi remembered it afterwards in words most readily though.

"I am a sibfriend of the mapmaker. I am happy they have found the connection to the herenow that they have been looking for. How long has it taken? Where is Rannockouch in your skies?"

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi told them, and they projected surprise and impatience. "So long!"

"Do you know where the Map is?"

"The mapmaker made many maps. Which one?"

It was hard to be impatient in the synctium, where time was so distorted as to be almost a mythical concept. "The networks. The one that ells... how it all fits together."

The Old One laughed again, but it was a sad laugh. "I think you'll have to ask the mapmaker themself about that."

"How do I reach them? They rooted by the main den?"

"Yes, but not in the Thicket. Out by the Harshness! You'll know the place when you get there."

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi tried to press the Old One for more but they drifted away, seeming regretful.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi slipped slowly back to the herenow. They felt even more bemused than before, but at least had dtermined that they needed to get back to the main den sooner rather than later.

* * *

* * *

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi arrived at the main den to an air of general festivity. It was like they had just had a germination feast, but Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi would have heard something about this on the high net if so.

Eventually they found their sibfriend, Ussi-Ullumi.

"There were Visitors here," they didn't seem impressed. "And they need to eat. As much as a germination feast, but they eat this every day."

"Why? Their bodies don't make what they need? Are they sick? How many were there?"

They walked together in the dappled shade beneath billoway trees, under the lowering orange sun of fourth quarter. It felt good to be back here, in the environment Calscinthi had been sown to, despite how much they had changed.

"More than we've seen at once before. During the shortnight they made their own light to play at daytime, and during the longnight they slept."

"I heard they do that. It's not very... efficient. Do they live a very long time?"

"I don't know. I haven't had much to do with them. You can ask Tenna-Yhe-Cala though! They got back a few days ago. They've been up at Rusterluck and the Visitors have this enormous... thing... out to see, like they've made their own island. Tenna-Yhe-Cala went there, stepped foot on it."

"I haven't seen Tenna-Yhe-Cala for so long. Not really since after their germination. Can you believe it?"

"I can hardly believe you're both Flowered. I feel like I have some work to do."

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi smiled and squeezed their sibfriend. "It's not a competition!"

The pair arrived at a wide burbling stream. It flowed down a small hill, tumbling over rocks, cascading in miniature waterfalls. The jungle intruded everywhere into the water, the place was thick with broad leafy ferns and overhanging moss-draped vines. Round flat leaves floated in the pools of water that accumulated between falls, and soft, big-petalled flowers dotted the place, pale yellows, pinks, and whites. Large, fat mushrooms with white stems and glossy brown caps stood proud in a small group on one mossy bank.

A little way up the hill, an enormous ancient tree straddled the stream, as if standing tall to look down over everything below. It filled the view, each side disappearing into the surrounding foliage, and its top ascending beyond the canopy of the surrounding trees. Its trunk was pale, almost white, and bunched in gnarly complicated patterns. The uppermost branches which were visible were spindly, and carried a few three-pronged leaves, which fluttered in what little breeze there must be high up there; the tree appeared to be clinging to them with all its strength while the leaves tried desperately to break free.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi and Ussi-Ullumi climbed the hill alongside the stream, pulling each other up the steepest parts, stepping on rocks that were nestled amongst the undergrowth like steps, or wedging their feet behind strong saplings for leverage.

At the base of the tree, beside a root thicker than Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's torso, Ussi-Ullumi wished them well. "Here I leave you. This is a big choice for you, an important moment. I feel like there should be more ceremony. More of us to see you in."

"I made this choice long ago," Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi smiled, almost sadly. "And I've had plenty of ceremony this past season. Still, I'm glad you were here to walk with me."

"Me too." They embraced, tightly, like they would not see each other again. But Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi would only be gone for a day at most.

"I'll see you tomorrow."

Ussi-Ullumi walked back down the hill, and Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi went into the tree.

"Do you have an appointment?" A voice croaked from the darkness.

"I do," Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi laughed. "Remember me, respected elders?"

Two Seeded emerged, arm in arm, supporting each other. One was tall, wide, unusually massive. The other was skeletal, made smaller by their sibfriend's bulk. Apart from their sizes, they looked almost identical. Pale blueish skin with petals covering their heads, necks and cheeks. Beady, piercing eyes, disproportionately big hands which were covered in thousands of minuscule extra senses, capable of performing the most delicate operations. They wore matching light green barkspun robes.

"You have flowered since we last saw you, young one," Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi embraced each of them in turn. "And the name you have discovered for your Flowered self is of the mapmaker. Yet I don't think your discovery is complete?"

"Oh, it's complete," said Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi, although they weren't entirely sure if that had been a question. "It is complete, and I must ready myself for the samara."

"You must, you must," sang the smaller of the pair, Enlini-Maqa-Allorasa-Enqo. "But no story of needs or wants."

"Both," said Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi. "I need and I want to leave with the samara." That was the plan. It had always been the plan. It was needed, at any rate, and there wasn't room for want in that. Certainly there was no place on Nem that Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi needed to be, or that needed them there. So the answer must lay away from Nem. It always had.

"A grand adventure," hummed Inile-Qama-Allorasa-Semiti. "The journey of a lifetime."

"Of several lifetimes, perhaps," said Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi, feeling a sudden rush at the realness of it all, the closeness.

The two Seeded led Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi into the center of the tree. It was a catacomb of twisting wooden walls, no straight line in sight. Some of the passages were narrow, looked too narrow for Inile-Qama-Allorasa-Semiti; but somehow they squeezed and twisted their body through with ease.

A hot spring from deep in the earth joined the stream beneath the tree. The ground underfoot, where it wasn't a tangle of solid roots, was moist and warm.

The very heart of the tree contained many chambers - Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi didn't know how many - each with a shallow pool of gently steaming, cloudy water, channeled through paths formed by the tree's root system from the underground source. Clouds of steam filled the air, obscuring the inner trunk and silhouetting the figures of Enlini-Maqa-Allorasa-Enqo and Inilne-Qama-Allorasa-Semiti.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi followed them along the route they had walked many times before. They remembered their first visit, when they were just a plumule, the fear of the steam,of not seeing what or who was around the corner. Of being alone in this place without their sibfriends. Of wondering if they would come out again. Of who they'd be when they came out again.

It had all been fine of course. Mundane, in the end. Strange, how the most everyday things can loom so threateningly over a young mind.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi entered one of the chambers with a pool in the center. There wasn't much space around the edge; the pair of guides waited outside while Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi stepped into the water. It glowed a little, a ghostly greenish white, lit from below by luminescent weeds. It was clouded with tiny bubbles and particles, so Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's hands and feet disappeared from view as soon as they put them down. The pool was only just enough for them to submerge themself completely when they lay flat on their back, but could have gone on to the center of the planet for all that was visible. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi lowered themself carefully down, leaned back. The bottom of the pool was silt and sludge; a little gritty, but mostly soft, and moulded itself to Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's form. They lowered their shoulders, then head, submerged their ears, then finally their whole face.

After their last visit here, they could keep enough oxygen in their body for days without a breath, but even without that, the organisms in the water provided what was needed.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi felt the familiar tingle of hyphae on their skin. The organisms in the water caressed their body, folding gently around their limbs. It was comforting; a return home, a familiar place after a long journey.

Before the 'duction could begin, Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's body eeded to be fully healed. The brytosphere was always different from here. They sank back and emerged in the night sky, surrounded by stars. There was no ground underfoot, and Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's feet moved to mimic walking, but they were held, suspended.

Farne loomed, enormous, off to one side. Far bigger than if they were seeing it from the ground. It glowed bright with reflected sunlight, but the sun was nowhere in sight. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi looked down, and beneath their feet the planet of Nem rotated, as if it was turned by their steps. Tendrils of silver light found their way to the parts of Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's body that needed something. Their guide was the moon; Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi angled themself to walk towards it.

They walked and Nem turned, and they slipped out of time.

In the herenow, Enlini-Maqa-Allorasa-Enqo and Iniline-Qama-Allorasa-Semiti prepared the carriers for the 'duction, carefully designed and honed over seasons to bring the changes Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi needed. They introduced them one by one to the substrate that fed the mycelium, which in turn delivered them to Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's body. The right genes, to the right cells, at the right moment.

Some of the stars had become shooting stars. The edges of Farne started to blur. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi looked at their hands and feet; they were blurring also. A waterfall rushed by, a great torrent close to their head, just the sound of it. The planet below was still crisp and clear, but shrouded in storm clouds, like the monsoon season had arrived everywhere at once.

The roar of the falls got louder. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi lost track of their feet. They were deep in the swamp, up to their ankles, then their knees. Something was wrong with the brytosphere! Farne, the guide, the destination, disappeared, then reappeared again, smaller, up ahead. The swam was there, underfoot, cold and wet and shrouded in a low hanging mist, but so was Nem, still turning. The mist and the storm clouds were one and the same. Of course, this wasn't the brytosphere. It must be the herenow. They were walking through the swam at night, stars out and Farne overhead, lighting the way, friends and warmth awaiting them at the far side. They knew the way because they had the map. They patted their pocket to make sure it was still there, a bulge of folded cloth. Must be the other pocket. Inside again, no map, no route, no destination. They stopped walking and bent to search in the murky waters, their hands caught among rushes and weeds and thick, clinging algae. They had it a minute ago, it couldn't be far away... They looked up at the sky and Farne was big again. THe map was etched into its surface. Of course, it always had been.

Farne and Rannouckouch took up the whole sky, having no room for stars or space. It was as bright as day. Saba-Urma-Calscinthi was seeing them through a gap in the thick canopy. Vines sung all around, adorned with flowers, draped with mosses. Everything soaked in ethereal planetlight. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi floated up, out of the swamp, through the vines, ducking and twisting to avoid getting caught. They crested the canopy and reached up towards Farne; finally their ascent was begun. But they slowed, stopped in the air. They could move still, suspended above the treetops, but only forwards or backwards or side to side. Up and down were out of reach. Perhaps they could see the wide net from here, the overstory from the overstory. It would be a special gift, to see the network. To see its presence in the herenow. Nobody could see it, only its effects.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi looked around, rotating their body a full turn. The canopy went on form miles in every direction, smooth and even like a grassland. Farne and Rannouckouch were gone from the sky, Nem must have turned away. Only stars remained. Where was everyone? Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi felt like they were supposed to be celebrating something, but they couldn't do it on their own.

Then Farne and Rannouckouch were by their side, in their people forms, taking a hand each. Farne was slick and silver, a strange unnatural surface, like a moonlit pool made solid. They had no face, only craters for eyes.

Rannouckouch was broad but fragile looking, insubstantial somehow. They had a Flowered's bodybut a plumule's face, all curious innocence. They were covered in petals from head to foot, but the colour of them Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi couldn't place, couldn't quite focus on long enough to see what it was.

Farne reached into Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's pocket and pulled out the map, pressed it into their chest, but Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi couldn't take it because Farne and Rannouckouch held their hands so tightly. The map fell, tumbling to the trees below, slipping between leaves and branches, disappearing into the thick undergrowth. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi tried to pull their hands free, tried to ask to be released, but the more they struggled the tighter they were held, and their voice didn't work.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi opened their eyes to a green haze. They opened their mouth and water poured in. _This_ was the herenow. It had felt so much like the herenow before, but it couldn't have been, because this was. They sat up, head and shoulders out of the pool, spluttering.

Farne, the map, the overstory... It faded into a dream.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi coughed up water and rubbed their eyes. Enlini-Maqa-Allorosa-Enqo and Iniline-Qama-Allorosa-Semiti were waiting to take Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's hands and lift them to their feet.

The rest of the night came in fits and starts. Saa-Urmra-Calscinthi awoke periodically to the inside of a cocoon, suspended from fine, strong threads, like a fly caught in a web. In between that, they were walking across the brytosphere, or dreaming of the flight over the world. Sometimes they found themself in the synctium, wandering among their own memories and those of others, losing track of which was which; losing track of who they were, like that moment of being the nexus.

And once or twice they were surfing the high net, dancing across messages that toured the world, checking in on friends in the sky tower, Rusterluck, the western reefs, the eastern mountains, and then broadcasting their own story for anyone who was listening.

They wouldn't remember much of this when they woke up, but the people whom they had contacted would do. The 'duction muddle, common enough as a side effect, but Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had never had it before.

When they came around again, it was the longnight again. They were stretched out in a hammock, under the sky, stars obscured by branches and leaves. For a moment they thought it was still a dream, that they were floating again or back in the brytosphere. But the breeze and the fireflies and the sounds of the wold gradually came into focus. The hammock was hanging from one of the branches of the great tree over the stream. The ground was an easy hop away, should they choose to get down. A steaming bowl rested on a broad branch within arms reach, as if someone had placed it there and then left a mere moment before Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had opened their eyes.

They sat up, and took the bowl in hand. The hammock swung only a little as they moved.

They drained the hot drink in one. It wasn't pleasant. Healing herbs and compounds to ease the integration of the new genes, mixed into some of the water Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had been treated in.

They sat for a while. The jungle seemed totally still, except for the gentle swaying of the hammock. They listened to their body, trying to find the changes. There was nothing, yet.

After some time, Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi heard a rustle below. Ussi-Ullumi waved from the ground. Tenna-Yhe-Cala raised both arms above their head and flapped their arms enthusiastically.

* * *

The community of Clifface was named descriptively. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi always enjoyed visiting, though they had trouble getting about most of the place.

It was the quite dramatic dividing line between the jungle and the desert: a severe drop-off at the southern end of the jungle, as tall as a mountain. The Setchnan dry forest was at its base, comprising a thick canopy of spiky, scrubby looking trees and viciously bedaggered cacti that, after coming from the lush rainforest greenery, looked like they were barely clinging on to life. Beyond that was the desert proper, where the Visitors had built another one of their strange habitats. The best route was not through the bush, but under the dry forest.

Clifface was a vertical den. A strip of the bare rock face looking out onto the dry forest was pockmarked and creviced, with nooks and ledges and coves just big enough to provide living space for several thousand people. They were the desert watchers, the southern lookouts, and had been among the first to see and understand the arrival of the Visitors two seasons ago.

They were all adapted to living here, to scrambling up and down the sheer rock face without ropes or ladders or steps. Most had extra limbs; the most common change was to four arms, but some had six like an insect, or four legs, or multipurpose middle limbs that could both support and carry. Whatever was needed by the relationship between their body and this world.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi entered Clifface along a track so narrow they had to put one foot directly in front of the other. They didn't look at the drop, but steadied themself with one hand against the dusty rock to their side, pleased to find the suckers on their arms and palms were now effective enough to provide a reassuring grip. Perhaps they would be able to get around unaided after all, this time.

There was a person-sized inset nook where the sloping path changed direction sharply, switching back on itself to continue downwards. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi paused in the gap - which was plenty big enough to feel secure; the occupants of Clifface were on average taller and broader than people who lived in either the jungle, mountains, or coast.

Braced with both their arms on the rock, they leaned forward a little and peered down.

Clifface bristled with activity, the brown, gold, red and orange bodies of its occupants swarming over the vertical expanse like insects, all the way to the bottom of the cliff. They all seemed to move so fast, a constant rush. The pace of life here was faster than anywhere Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had ever been.

They continued down the path, which turned back on itself twice more before coming to an end. Next came the hard part.

"Hey slow-mover, do you need a hand? Or four?"

A head appeared by Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's feet, wide and red, covered in a light fur with a broad smile and big round eyes set far apart. they waved all four of their hands to demonstrate their point, and Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had no idea what they were holding on with.

"No, thanks," Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi replied, trying to sound confident. "I think I'll be alright by myself."

"Are you sure?" The stranger said cheerfully. "You don't look like you're from around here."

"Good guess> But I got some modifications recently and I'd like to try them out."

"Good luck!" They shrugged and waved and the head disappeared.

There would always be someone else to help, Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi though, if they got stuck. This would be the first time they descended unaided though; the first time they thought they had any chance whatsoever at making it.

They looked down over the ledge on which they stood. There was nowhere immediately obvious to step, or hold on to. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi took a deep breath, and reached their left foot into nothing. The lowered it down by about the length of their shin, then pressed their sole to the rock as if it was the ground. They felt their foot attach, a strange tickling feeling. Palms on the ledge, they lifted their right foot, and stepped over.

That first step was the hardest. They walked down the rock, awkwardly, with feet flat but knees bent, their back flat against the rock and their hands and arms suckered onto the cliff. It was slow going, but Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's confidence in their 'ductions increased with every bit of shuffled progress.

Another stranger slowed down in passing to watch.

"You're doing great," they said, in a rich deep voice. "But try relaxing a bit. You're too tense. Don't be afraid of the fall. Someone will catch you."

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi smiled, too distracted by navigating a complicated outcrop to reply. When they passed it and looked up, the stranger was gone. But they contemplated the advice, and released the tension in their muscles. Their body ached from holding it. They weren't quite ready yet to trust that they would be caught, and the fall was still long, but they gradually slipped into a lighter step, touching the wall only with a palm or forearm, leaning forward more, letting themself drop occasionally to a ledge or a nook.

Everyone they passed moved with their face to the rock, back facing outwards into the air. Perhaps not being continuously confronted by the view could be less nerve-wracking. They turned around. Immediately things seemed a lot easier. They could see where they were going by looking down between their feet, and without their knees at a strange angle the movement felt much more natural.

After a while, the second stranger was back. "Now you're getting it!" They climbed alongside for a while, so Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi introduced themself.

"I'm Moba-Bemni-Cao," they said. "Where are you heading?"

"Through the dry forest and out to the Visitors' transport den. They've offered me a lift to Farne."

"Interesting! You must be headed out to the samara then?"

"That's right. How could you tell?"

"Well, you don't look like you're from Farne," they said with a grin. "Do you know some of the Visitors?"

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi shook their head. "A sibfriend of mine arranged things. I'm a bit nervous to be honest, but they can speak their language so I think it will be okay. It will be very strange going in one of their machines though. I'm not sure I trust it. It seems really... isolating."

"I wouldn't wish for it," said Maba-Bemni-Cao. "But I'm too attached to my rock. Look, we're almost at the bottom."

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's new friend bade them good luck and set off horizontally, and Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi comleted the climb alone. Towards the base of the cliff it started to become gradually shallower, until finally it was like walking down a slope and Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi no longer needed to hold on.

The dry forest began almost as soon as the land completely evened out. There was no sensible route through. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi walked a route they remembered to a tall cave in the cliff face of Clifface and went inside.

Out of the sun, Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi almost shivered. The temperature difference was incredible. They hadn't worked up a sweat during the climb because their body reabsorbed and stored any hint of moisture that might escape. They pulled their bulky pocketed cloak around themself as they approached the back of the cave, and the tunnel entrance.

It was quiet. They nodded a polite greeting to someone coming out in the opposite direction.

The tunnel was long and curved in Ss under the desert. The memory of how it came to be had been long since lost to the depths of the synctium, but it seemed to Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi that it might once have been an underground river, winding its way through a maze of different types of bedrock, eating a path through only the softest of them. It was completely dry now.

Right at the end, the tunnel forked into three. One lead up to the surface, where the Visitors and their strange contraptions would be waiting. One led down into a cavern full of stalagmites and stalactites, where truly ancient Old Ones still whispered to anyone who could listen carefully enough. The other lead down too, but not as deeply, to some storage areas that had fallen into disuse hundreds of years ago.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi headed for those. Their body was weary and their skin and head sore from the sun. They would have no access to the brytosphere from the Visitors' flying box.

The den that had been here a very long time ago had been small. It used to really be the last outpost before the desert began. The last contact with people for anyone who chose to journey across it. Not many ever had, in all that time. The mapmaker was one of only hundreds.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi sat in the middle of an irregularly shaped room with shelves carved - or naturally formed - into the walls, empty nooks now. They connected to the wide net and walked lazily, automatically, across a cooling plain of damp mossy grass. But their thoughts were above ground. The den that had been here had been swallowed by the desert more than two and a half thousand years ago. Still, the mapmaker had been here, before then, at both the beginning and end of their journey.

_Well, I'm at the end of mine now,_ thought Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi. _And the beginning, too. Some questions are not meant to be answered. That is my lesson, my discovery._

* * *

The Visitors had turned the desert sand into something Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had never felt before. It was cold, and perfectly smooth, reflecting the hazy yellow grey of the dust-filled sky. For some reason the Visitors' shuttles had to wait for the sandstorm to pass; they couldn't navigate without visuals? Or perhaps grains of sand interfered with the moving parts in their complicated machines. Whatever it was, the risks had subsided enough for them to start preparing for their launch.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi flexed their emerging sets of wings. They made a little buzzing noise. The wings would do nothing to lift them from the ground on Nem, but in the lower gravity of Farne and as part of the samara they would provide a useful means of maneuvering quickly. In theory.

They were already feeling heavier; the brytosphere didn't seem to have an answer to that. It was what they needed, after all. Like they were back in the waters of the Breesh Mar swamp, heavy mud clinging to their shins, making every step a chore.

New senses were starting to work, too. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi's brain was learning quickly how to interpret new inputs. As they watched the Visitors in the distance, rushing around setting up their machines, they could feel the magnetic fields of Nem like a map layered over there herenow. They could amost see the various celestial particles radiating from the shuttles as their engines powered up.

The Visitors' artificial lights, which had been blinding before, were manageable now; Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi could adjust their pupils consciously and rapidly to compensate for any glare.

Farne loomed, a silver smile in the inky darkness overhead. Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi ignored it, and strode over to where the Visitors' shuttles were almost ready for departure. The ground felt acutely alien. The Visitors ran around, waving their glowing devices and calling to each other in their scratchy language, emitting their exotic smells. Another group of Visitors approached the shuttles from the other direction, and suddenly Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi felt like they were already on a distant planet. They were the alien in this scene, the odd one out.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi was close enough to make out the new arrivals. There were three of them; two the same as all of the others, upright and pale in their white uniforms, but the third who walked between them was gnarled and hunched over, leaning heavily on two canes, shuffling forwards with what looked like agonising steps. Despite the differences, Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi could recognise age. The two on either side seemed desperate to help, but held themselves back, patiently matching the middle one's pace and speaking softly. The stooped one had deep set eyes, brown skin wrinkled like a bruma fruit, and a burst of white hair that seemed to float about in all directions as if it was already free from the gravity of the planet and was just waiting for the rest of the body to catch up.

The trio were heading towards the same shuttle that Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi had been told to board. Most likely the shuttle would drop Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi off on Farne, and then continue on to the Visitors' constellation of samaras in orbit around Nem.

Saba-Urmra-Calscinthi braced themself, consciously relaxed, and then followed the Visitors up the boarding ramp and into the shuttle.

## A Story, Retold

Cryptum Effingis Daracrin a-Teprem sent his assistant away for the third time that morning. Or perhaps it had been three different assistants, he couldn't keep track any more. He knew they were only trying to help, but their constant hovering was just so bothersome. And he could manage unpacking his office just fine by himself.

There was a knock at the door, light and hesitant, like the knocker would prefer not to be heard. Effingis slammed the stack of note sheaves he had just lifted from a box onto the desk, hard, making assorted bits of equipment rattle.

"No, _thank you_," he boomed. "I can manage!"

The door opened gently a couple of inches.

"Um, Cryptum, Sir, I'm sorry to bother you it's just that-"

"What?" Effingis demanded, snatching the edge of the door and sliding it all the way open. He squinted down at the short-haired, mousy, white-coated lab assistant across the threshold. The assistant seemed to be attempting to disappear behind a palm-sized digital pad clutched in both hands.

"Well Cryptum, there's the department meeting just down the hall, and Cryptum Merrik seemed to think that, well, I think they all want, I mean, they asked me to come and fetch you."

"Ah." Effingis sighed, and stopped trying to loom intimidatingly. "Right. Very good."

_Was it really that time already?_ It hardly seemed five minutes since the last department meeting. Or was that a cohort meeting? There were so many meetings now the voyage was at an end, and everyone seemed to think he should be in all of them.

"Will I tell them...?"

"I'll be along in a few minutes. No need to wait for me." The assistant scurried off with a look of relief. "I won't forget," muttered Effingis under his breath.

He finished shuffling the sheaves he had been moving around, undecided about where to file them. Everything was related to everything else somehow, and each generation of assistants seemed to come up with a new and innovative way of organising things. This didn't matter so much when all of the data was in the computers, but Effingis needed to be able to touch and stack and turn pages. The sheaves synchronised automatically with the central databases, but that did nothing to help him find the particular sheaf when he needed it in the physical world.

Cryptum Effingis sat down for a moment in the stark and uncomfortable metal chair that had come with the new office. It was cold, and the edges of the seat seemed dangerously sharp. The gravity planetside was definitely taking some getting used to. It was about double what they had been able to manufacture on the Daracrin. He would have preferred to stay in orbit, had done so for as long as possible, but the planetside research committee had insisted he join them in person and he had conceded in the end. He _was_ the most knowledgeable about Nemta after all.

It was strange to finally be here. Effingis had spent eighty years of his life studying the place, bringing together historical records, myths and legends, and matching them with the advanced probe data and the ever-increasing volume of live readings coming into the sensors of the ship itself as they drew closer. The fact that he was there - could breathe the air and touch the soil (he _hadn't_ touched the soil, but he _could_ if he wanted to. He didn't) - still hadn't quite solidified in his mind. Every time he made the window in his sleeping pod transparent he was surprised to be greeted with a view of leafy green foliage instead of the black emptiness of space. His brain translated the rush of the river that flowed under Newland Outpost Three into the deep engine hum of the Daracrin he was used to. He supposed he would get used to it all eventually.

Finally he sighed and hauled himself to his feet. He shuffled off down the corridor to the large conference room where the various institute heads would be waiting for him. They were, he suspected, struggling to prioritise projects to focus on, and running out of students and researchers to process data, what with all of the extra input that was coming in from the autonomous nanoprobes that had been sent out into the environment some weeks back. He was bleakly sure that they would all much prefer that he got on and died, so they could get his knowledge directly from the Volt instead of having to ask him for it.

-------

* * *

Newland Outpost Three had a domed observatory built into the top. It was strictly off-limits for leisure use, but of course the rules didn't apply to Cryptum Effingis.

There was a moderately comfortable grey padded bench in the center of the room. It could have done with some armrests or cushions, but Effingis made the best of it. He was not particularly tall, and could lay back comfortably across the surface with his knees bent and legs tented, and stare up at the cosmos.

He missed the Daracrin.

Soon the distantly orbiting base station would come into view. When they had arrived, the four remaining of the six ships that had set out on their five hundred year journey had connected themselves together in an X formation, and then been quickly extended outwards to form a space station that now looked more like a wheel with four spokes. They would not be coming apart again. Although Effingis and many others still thought of the individual ships that made up the station, essentially the Daracrin was no more.

The extra bright star that was the station appeared at the edge of the dome for a moment, then promptly vanished behind a tuft of cloud almost as dark as the night sky behind it. The station was named Ripnorth, after the two ships that didn't make it: Ripisude and Sobenorth. Effingis hadn't known anyone on board either; they had been lost long before he was born.

He hadn't been sleeping well these past few weeks. While in terms of space and amenities, Newland Outpost Three was practically luxurious compared to the Daracrin, he felt stifled and trapped. He never opened his window or went out onto the balconies because the air was too humid and smelled funny, and highly irritating insects were liable to land on him. Besides, windows weren't supposed to open. That just wasn't something they should do.

Over to the south, he knew, was one of the more densely populated local settlements, but there was not a single light to be seen, even from the highest vantage point in the outpost. Two of this assistants had returned from a field trip there a couple of days ago, and come back gushing about the welcome they had received from the locals, and thoroughly exhilarated from their first experience of camping in the jungle. Or, indeed, camping anywhere. They had, Effingis gathered from their scattered and messy reports, been housed with babies in a nursery of some kind.

He had arranged that the next group to go out would take a telepresence drone with them, so he could see and hear what they were doing in near enough real time, and save him having to plough through their tedious written summaries. He didn't know who had been tutoring this Breatsch generation, but their supposed official reports read like rambling diaries. There was no scientific rigour whatsoever.

By the time Ripnorth had passed back into view, Effingis had nodded off, still flat on his back, a slurred growling coming from the back of his throat.

"I tell you, there's no electricity, no power source of any kind, anywhere in the village!"

"I'd hardly call it a village, there are two hundred thou-"

"Look they must have something, they have a colony on the moon for goodness sake. How did they get there without a way to make energy?"

"It must be something we've never seen, that our sensors can't pick up. Some particle..."

"A _lost_ colony don't forget..."

"Well have you tried just asking them?"

"We're still having some trouble with the language when it comes to talking about technology..."

"No, no, they found it again..."

"Did they? I must have missed that."

"Not recently, a hundred odd years ago local. Look it's all in Ancht Marus et al's paper from the Last Year. I'll send it over."

Cryptum Effingis let the muddle of voices wash over him. There were twelve students around the conference table, and his assistant for the week, the polite Breatsch T'Lin, who was dutifully trying to take minutes into the surface pad in front of her.

"Let's get back on track, please!" Br. Manty, the de-facto leader of the little rabble knocked on the table with his knuckles. It didn't have any effect.

Cryptum Effingis pushed his chair back, making a gut-wrenching scraping sound against the metal floor. This didn't do anything to stop the cross talk either. Effingis left the room and walked down the corridor to the small communal kitchen. Br. T'Lin looked after him wide-eyed, torn between her attempts to document the meeting and her self-imposed duty to diligently attend the Cryptum at all times. The latter won out, and she scurried out behind him.

Effingis contemplated the various buttons on the drink dispensor. He pushed two buttons together, and the nozzle spat out his signature blend hot drink: a sweet and spicy stimulant called allura. It was a deep space special, something that hadn't existed when their ancestors left Tepremen.

Br. T'Lin lurked nervously in the doorway. "Cryptum, is everything alright? I Could have fetched that for you."

Effingis sighed. "It's quite alright, Breatsch. The group needs to get their chit chat out of their system, and then we'll get onto some serious work."

"Yes Cryptum," Br. T'Lin didn't seem sure.

When he returned to the conference room, Cryptum Effingis remained standing until the students finally did fall silent. He sipped his allura, and cleared his throat.

"One at a time, going around spinwise, starting with you," he pointed with his mug, "number one priority for further study, and why. Two sentences max. If someone else says yours, pick another or pass. If someone else says one you wish you'd thought of, remember it (silently). Breatsch T'Lin, write them down. You, Breatsch Talub, go."

They went around. Ten of the twelve students came up with something original. Br. T'Lin projected her surface screen upwards, so the list hovered over the middle of the table where they could all read it. The suggestions ranged from the practicalities of how Nemtans (local Nemtans, Effingus had to remind himself) reproduce, to whether or not the locals actually originated on Rannouckouch and migrated over millennia ago. Breatsch Vissingis thought it was imperative they forgot about their jungle settlement and focus on the moon colony instead. Breatsch Elanim  was convinced they were on the cusp of a medical breakthrough based on the locals' apparent ability to heal themselves.

Cryptum Effingis was disappointed. None of them had suggested the one thing he _really_ wanted to study. Well, if none of them were interested, he could make it his own project.

Over the course of the next rotation, he guided the students through whittling down their ideas, finding connections and dependencies between them, helping them all to make sense of the instincts that drove them toward particular avenues. For some of the areas he could provide insight - or at least further reading - from his own decades of research. By the time he was satisfied he had wrestled some sort of coherence from the group, it was dark outside. Effingis hated these seemingly random segments of darkness for stretches of the daytime, when the sun disappeared behind some of the enormous pieces of debris that littered the inner system. Just something else to get used to.

Cryptum Effingis dismissed the students and sat back in his chair to gaze at the final shortlist of projects for the year. They were an interdisciplinary bunch, drawn from each academic institute on Daracrin; except for Br. Assidua, who was from Vansage. It was pure chance that most of them were from Effingis' home vessel. The computers had put the group together, optimising for diversity of interests and alignment of fields of expertise. It was the same mechanism they had always used aboard the ships. It was too soon to say how well that would work down here, now they could mix and match people from the four vessels.

According to the list still hovering above the table, the group had elected to focus on: long distance travel (frequency, reasons, means); healing (self, each other, speed, mechanisms, injury, illness); and records and history (oral? written? remembered?).

Effingis was pleased with that last one. He was pretty sure the locals had developed some kind of ancestral memory, but it was just a theory. Getting access to it would likely open up a lot of doors in other areas. Breatsch Amba had thought of that one. The others had dismissed it as unscientific at first, but Amba had made a compelling case. Effingis was somewhat irrationally proud of her; her genetic father, Nradum Pham Daracrin a-Uisir, had been Effingis' mentor when he was a student, and close friend until Nr. Pham's death forty years before. That was long before Breatsch Amba Daracrin a-Zeloa had been birthed of course. Effingis had to be careful not to let on he knew, sometimes; it was only his privileged access to the central database that let him make such connections. In any case, she was bright - well, they all were - and he imagined she showed some of her genetic parents' aptitude for looking for threads of narrative to figure things out, rather than relying on cold data alone.

"Excuse me, Cryptum?" Br. T'Lin interrupted his thoughts. Effingis grunted.

"Do we know... Why the Nemtans are so different from us? I mean, is it them who changed, or us? Or both?"

Cryptum Effingis smiled indulgently and motioned T'Lin to come around to his side of the table. He pulled the projection from the surface screen back in, then tapped about on the controls, bringing up information from the Volt and central database.

"It's an interesting question. See, these records here," he pointed and scrolled around, "strongly suggest that the locals were more or less as they are now when our ancestors left Nemta. Although as we were very spread out on the continent with the desert in between, it's debatable how much contact we actually had with them."

He had slipped into saying "we" instead of "they" when talking about the Nemtans who had left, three millennia before and ultimately ended up on Teprem, and decided he liked the taste of it. "It's actually more difficult to say how much _we_ changed. Our ancestors had a habit of making records about everything but themselves, it seems. But it's most likely that the thousand year exodus had some impact, and then we adapted to life on Teprem as well."

"But it's not long enough for full on evolutionary change?"

"That's right. We suspect the population was severely depleted at one point, and then reestablished from a smaller gene pool. Well, we can see just by looking the locals have a lot more genetic diversity than we do."

"But we're really the same? At the core?"

"Yes we are," said Effingis. "We're all human."

"And we... they... our ancestors, I mean. _All_ left the planet?"

"Either that," Effingis nodded, "or the ones who stayed died out soon after. It wasn't a very hospitable region."

"Why didn't they just, you know, move north?"

"Another great question," Effingis sighed. "Let's hope the local histories have some insight for us on that."

Br. T'Lin looked thoughtful. "Thank you Cryptum," she said. Then, shyly, "I hope I can join your research group some day."

Br. T'Lin was of the youngest and final wave of the Breatsch generation to be birthed. It occurred to Effingis rather jarringly that he might no longer be around when the time came for her to garduate into studentship.

Cryptum Effingis stood up, suddenly perturbed. "Your working time is over, you should take a break. Send me those notes-"

"They're already synced."

"-and then go and find something else to do. You might like to read about the southern poles, for example."

Effingis marched towards the door. "I'll see you after lunch." It wasn't long before it would be light again, judging from the gradual brightening beyond the corridor windows. But enough time for a nap, perhaps.

Most of the Volt hardware was up on Ripnorth, running through the hulls of all four ships. When the ships had been assembled into the station, it had begun to extend itself through the connecting infrastructure, and into the central hub as well. There were a handful of Volt Fragments - each outpost had one, and Newland had four - which worked as if they were still part of the primary, instantaneously mirroring any data that was uploaded to any part of it.

The Volt was also their link back to Tepremen, up to a point. They had discovered the limit to which separate parts could communicate with each other during the Crash of the two hundred and eleventh year of the voyage. Whatever the malfunction was that occurred in the Volt, it had cascaded into the central database and from there to some parts of the ships' systems. The five vessels had lost their already intermittent connection with each other, and when order was finally restored - or the chaos, at least, subdued - the Sobenorth had never reappeared. On the Daracrin, the whole Nulas generation of embryos awaiting but not yet committed to long term storage were lost as well.

-----------------

* * *

"Cryptum, Breatsch Dneel is here to see you." Effingis's office door slid open noiselessly and a dark-skinned, dark-haired young woman stood, framed by the door's arch, looking eager.

She held a box the size of her torso, squeezing it against herself with her arms. The way T'Lin had announced this visitor made it sound like she had an appointment, but Cryptum Effingis recalled no such thing. He squinted suspiciously at T'Lin, who stepped aside to let this Breastch Dneel enter. Their arms brushed and their eyes made brief contact as they passed each other in the doorway. Breatsch T'Lin hurried out, closing the door behind her. Effingis grunted, and glowered at the spare seat in the corner of the crowded room. It was covered in storage drives and sheafs.

Dneel remained standing, but put the box on the floor at her feet with a rattle.

"Breatsch...?"

"Breatsch Dneel Vansage a-Yei, Cryptum. It's an honour to meet you." She sounded sincere, and not gushing. Her words were precise, her accent clipped, typical of the Vansage crew.

Effingis sighed. "What can I do for you, Breatsch Dneel Vansage a-Yei? Forgive me, but I seem to have lost my notes on the reason for our appointment."

Dneel looked keen to get down to business. "Cryptum, I have a proposal for a field experiment." She reached into the box and produced two items, holding them out towards Effingis, one in each hand. "In short, I would like to take a selection of our artefacts from Tepremen out to the _maurauna_ and discuss them with the Nemtans. To look for common ground using these objects as prompts. There are studies which show having physical props can help with-"

Effingis held up one hand. "What is your end goal?"

Dneel paused for a moment. "To learn what they think of us."

Cryptum Effingis tried not to smile. This was a route to finding out more about their own past on this planet that even he hadn't thought of. He pretended to think for a minute, but his mind was screaming at him to recruit this student. He looked at the items she held. One was a semi-spherical transparent dome containing a three dimensional internal sculpture of two faces laughing together; probably an image of people this Breatsch knew, rendered in plex. The other looked like a folded piece of cloth, thick and tough-looking, purplish in colour; it had some markings scratched or painted on, but Effingis couldn't make them out from where he was, and it appeared to be full of small holes as well.

"Which group are you in, currently?"

Breatsch Dneel looked guiltily at the floor.

"Are you a student?"

"Level one, Cryptum."

Effingis sighed. "Your enthusiasm does you credit. Under what auspices did you think you would be able to run this project?"

"Well, I thought perhaps, I could shadow a student in your group, or…" Dneel trailed off.

Cryptum Effingis waved his hand. "You know what, let me worry about the sheafwork. Write your proposal up, formally please, and concisely, including how you will gather the data and get results - you should already have covered that in your classes - and make another appointment and we'll take it from there."

Breatsch Dneel's eyes brightened.

"Yes Cryptum! Thank you Cryptum! Right away!"

She put the artefacts back into the box and stooped to pick it up. "Thank you again Cryptum. I'm looking forward to the chance to learn from you."

"Don't overdo it," he said, and tempered it with a smile when she looked scolded.

Dneel reversed out of the door, sliding it open just enough with one elbow.

T'Lin closed it from the other side, and he heard the two of them chattering excitedly for a few minutes before Dneel left.

Effingis sat back in his chair with his feet on the desk, and thought for a while. As far as he'd been able to tell from the reports that had come in about interactions with the locals so far, nobody had thought to communicate that they were descended from people who had lived on this land three millennia ago. The Nemtans presumably thought they were dealing with aliens from another place, especially given how different they were from each other. They were very relaxed about it all, the Nemtans, which was another reason Effingis was sure they must have had dealings with such visitors before. He would need to decide whether or not Dneel should disclose their origins in her work.

--------------

* * *

Cryptum Effingis realised he was looking at Newland Outpost Three from the outside for the first time. When he had first arrived it had been mostly dark, and the transport had come in along the river, then docked partially submerged and released its passengers through an airlock-type connecting passageway, so he hadn't had a chance to get a good look at the structure. It was quite elegant and impressive, he thought, with a glimmer of undeserved pride. But it also looked starkly alien against the backdrop of the jungle.

Part of Effingis had felt that they would fit right back in here, their genes and the planet remembering each other somehow, the ecosystem welcoming back its prodigal spawn. But it hadn't been that easy. Gravity, temperature, humidity; creeping, smothering plant and animal life; all conspired against the arrivals' equipment, and their bodies.

Probably it was better in Newland itself, far south in the mountains near the ancient city of Rasch a-Lurniq.

But Effingis hadn't been considering the weather when he was choosing his base. Te very notion of it was so abstract to a ninth generation spacer that even though he had the climate data, he hadn't understood what it meant in practice.

So here he was. As it happened, he was perfectly comfortable and dry and blissfully insect free as he peered into the wraparound screen that provided a multi-sensory replication of the telepresence drone's environment, from the safety of his office.

The boats were narrow and long; two people sitting side-by-side would be a tight fit. There were three of the boats with four students in each, plus satchels and boxes of equipment and consoles. Cryptum Effingis's telepresence drone was wedged in the middle of the final boat, strapped down but also carefully balanced between the knees of the two students on opposite sides. There had been no room for Breatsch T'Lin - and besides, Effingis needed her at the Outpost - so Breatsch Amba had offered to serve as his assistant for the field trip.

The group had left the Outpost that morning, launched boats from a little jetty, and were drifting down stream at a fairly leisurely pace. The boats had engines of course, but they kept them running slow and quiet so as not to disturb the wildlife or alarm the locals.

Effingis watched the curved spire of Newland Outpost Three disappear finally around a bend in the river. The structure seemed to rise from the river like a twisting claw, or a particularly focussed and neat wave. The main body of the Outpost sat, mostly suspended, over the center of the river. The water flowed underneath, and it was connected to each sheer bank like a bridge. Invisibly from the surface, the two ends of the bridge extended underground as well and joined up with each other on the riverbed.

A leaf, perhaps, not a claw, thought Effingis as he took in the huge variety of shapes and colours of foliage either side of the river. The drone's sight let him zoom, focus and even rewind and replay the view. And the Outpost tower reflected its surroundings reasonably well. It wasn't made from a completely mirrored material, but it was flat and reflective, if matt, so blended fairly well with its surroundings, from some angles at least. The more Effingis thought about it, the more Newland Outpost Three seemed to belong here after all.

The most direct route between the Outpost and the Nemtans' settlement had been impassible when the first cohort had arrived. The jungle was ruggedly hilly, with sharp drops and steep climbs, mostly concealed by the tangle of leafy bushes and trees and vines. The first arrivals had attempted to clear a path that their land vehicles could pass through, but had faced barrier after barrier; the jungle seemed to be fighting back. Eventually some of the locals came to see what was going on and offered their assistance. Effingis didn't know how they had done it - he had read the report, but it was vague and confusing - but now there was a narrow passage through the undergrowth that seemed natural, like it had always been there, with no signs of destruction whatsoever.

The boats crawled out of the river at a point where the bank was shallow enough to access. They rolled up the bank on a set of two revolving treads to join the path.

It took about two hours to reach the settlement this way. One of the other major impediments that the first cohort had faced was a wide gorge, edged by completely vertical overgrown sides. The drop looked less intimidating than it was, softened by a carpet of brightly blooming plants. But it was certainly a fall that would kill. To route around the gorge would more than double the length of the journey, and some sharp-eyed engineer had seen the remnants of a structure of some kind deep in the foliage on one side. It had looked natural at first, like an ancient tree stump, but it was strangely regular in shape, with evenly spaced slots around the edge. Uncovering its totality had been a hard-won victory. The place was covered in the tiny wasp-flowers, as they had become known. Before the team clearing the area had realised the danger, one of their number had been brought close to death by the poison they contained. After that, nobody went anywhere near the area without robust protective gear covering all of their skin.

After a matching structure had been unearthed on the opposite side of the gorge, exactly in line with its counterpart, it didn't take long for them to construct a bridge all the way across. None of the engineers had ever had a need to build a bridge during their time in deep space, and were all excited to test the theories they had studied so intensively and to try out the computer simulations they had run in the physical.

It was the third attempt that stayed up and seemed, finally, safe for regular use. They named it Elsom Bridge, after Feilum Elsom K'Bel an-Imtux, an engineer who had plummeted into the gorge along with a large chunk of attempt number two.

Elsom Bridge was a little wider than the land boats, and they glided one at a time across it without incident. The route continued in a relatively straight line, running more or less parallel with the edge of the gorge for a while.

The novelty of the ride started to wear off when Cryptum Effingis wasn't identifying a plant he had never seen before every couple of minutes, and he took the headset off and got up to make himself a drink.

When he sat back down, the view through the  wraparound screen was slanted diagonally, and not moving. Effingis shook the device, then realised that was unlikely to make any difference. He fiddled with the settings, trying to correct the image for a couple of minutes, before realising he hadn't put the earbuds back in. As soon as he did it became apparent that whatever was happening was not a failure of the telepresence drone.

There were sounds of scuffling and banging, and distant shouts.

"What's going on?" He bellowed through the drone, but either the drone had been muted or nobody was paying attention. He triggered the emergency light that should draw someone's attention, but no-one came.

Effingis sent written messages to three of the students, one from each boat, and waited anxiously for a response. He buzzed Breatsch T'Lin, who appeared in seconds.

"Breatsch, something is wrong with the field group," he handed her the wraparound screen so she could see for herself. "What can we do?"

"I'll alert the faculty Planning and Rescue," she said, tapping into her palm screen, "but if there's any damage to the land boats they will already have heard."

"So there's nothing else we can do?"

"I can't think of anything. Try not to worry, Cryptum. I"m sure they'll be fine. WE're all used to getting ourselves out of scrapes, and they're not far away, and we know exactly where they are. They probably just lost control and hit a tree or something."

For all her assurances, T'Lin sounded more like she was trying to convince herself, than Effingis. The Cryptum was not reassured.

"It's wild out there! What if the Nemtans have turned on us. Or the _others_ are here."

"That's statistically unlikely, Cryptum. They have been nothing but helpful to us since-"

He cut her off with a wave of his hand and pressed an earbud as a new sound caught his attention. He snatched the headset back from T'Lin.

The view hadn't changed, but Effingis could hear two or three voices close by, just out of sight.

"-that's it, lift..."

"Three, two, one..."

"Uuuuunnnngghh!"

"Ow, watch my foot-"

"Shit it's slippery..."

"Be careful!"

"Mind that-" A yelp and a crash. "-root."

Then a cacophony of voices all talking over each other. Effingis flashed the emergency light insistently. T'Lin tapped him on the shoulder. "Have you run the diagnostics for the drone?"

"How do I do that?"

T'Lin showed him. "It all looks fine..." he said.

"No, see here," Breatsch T'Lin had (somehow) mirrored the output that was overlaid onto the video feed in the wraparound onto her own palm screen. "The emergency light is out. The bulb is broken."

"How do you deduce that from... Never mind. Can we fix it?"

T'Lin looked at Cryptum Effingis blankly for a second. "No. It's a hardware issue."

"I know that! Doesn't this drone have arms?"

"Cryptum, it does, but the light is tiny and embedded in the body, and the drone just has primitive grabbers, nothing that can handle anything delicate..."

"Alright, alright, I get the picture." Effingis sat back and crossed his arms. "We're useless to them."

THen his palm screen on the table beside him flashed an incoming message from Breatsch Jacqain: _don't worry, slight mishap, under control._

Effingis was still focussed on the wraparound so T'Lin - who got a copy of all of his messages anyway, for assistanting purposes - read it out to him.

"See. They're fine."

"Well. Good. But I want to know what's _happening_."

Just then Breatsch Amba's face appeared in the wraparound. Her auburn hair looked damp and messy and she had a smear of mud on one cheek, but she waved cheerily and wrenched the drone upright.

It wasn't a big piece of equipment - smaller than the average person's upper body - but it weighed more than most people expected. The reason was the experimental independent power source that took up a large portion of the drone's lower chassis. A sleek bit of panelling around the outside could covert sunlight into enough energy to power the thing indefinitely. And it could store enough to keep going through a shortnight, or longer. The physicists from Elmneth had come up with that one, and data from the drone would be streaming back to them for the duration of the outing. Apart from that, most of the rest of the drone's roughly cylindrical form was hollow, divided into useful weatherproof storage compartments.

Breatsch Amba righted the drone and unclipped the straps that had held it in place in the land boat. She turned to beckon someone else whom Effingis couldn't see. He heard her say: "-if we take the drone out it'll be easier to move the boat. The Cryptum can fire it up and it can move under its own steam..."

"Why do we need to lift it? Hey Cryptum, can you hover it out?"

"No, don't," interrupted Breatsch Amba. "There isn't room for the air cushion, it needs a clear space or it will trash the inside of the boat. Help me lift it."

The other voice, which Effingis recognised as Breatsch T'Mala when it came closer, was grumbling. They both passed out of sight, but Effingis could hear them groaning with exertion as the image he was seeing moved. The view jerked around until the pair had a decent grip, then shifted in a blurred arc as they, presumably, lifted the drone over the side of the land boat. Effingis heard a wet thunk as they set it heavily down onto the ground.

"Okay, you're clear," said Amba.

Cryptum Effingis floundered for the briefest moment, then remembered how to activate the drone's lift. It propelled itself sharply upwards in a short hop then filled the gap beneath itself with a bubble of air. Fallen leaves, moss and mud sprayed outwards and splattered up the sides of the drone as they were displaced. Amba and T'Mala jumped back with yelps.

"Thank you both," said Cryptum Effingis. He couldn't hear his own voice back, but the others had told him it sounded metallic and strange through the telepresence drone's speaker. "You're welcome Cryptum," said Amba. "If you just wait there, we'll..."

Cryptum Effingis expanded the air cushion vertically to raise the drone up to face height of the two students.

"I'll just get some practice in," he said, "it's bound to be different outside the lab!" He zoomed the machine away before either of them could argue. Breatsch T'Lin had reappeared at his side, looking mildly concerned, but said nothing.

Cryptum Effingis almost immediately collided with the land boat, but stopped just in time, a split second before Breatsch T'Lin might have intervened using her (somehow) backup set of controls. She seemed to be streaming his video feed onto a surface screen now, which Effingis added to the list of things he hadn't realised were possible. He was having too much fun to be annoyed than he didn't seem to be able to have anything to himself these days, but he shelved that emotion to come back to and brood on later.

Effingis lifted the drone higher into the air and rotated slowly to take stock of the situation.

It looked like the path had caved in underneath the middle land boat. Some kind of large, round sinkhole had opened up. The land boats had been travelling close together, end to end, so the stern of the front one and the prow of the rear had slipped promptly into the hole as well. It must have all happened exceptionally fast.

Four students at the front had unloaded all of their cargo and were pulling and pushing on the boat to shift it out of the hole. It finally started to slide in the right direction. Mud and leafy debris clung to the treads, which weren't moving.

"Hit the engine!" Yelled one of the students at the front. One of those at the rear hopped into the boat to start the motor, but their weight and momentum sent the whole thing lurching back into the hole, colliding with the middle land boat with a crash. Curses and howls of frustration echoed through the jungle canopy.

The seven students working on the back land boat were having better luck. Instead of sliding it, between them they had managed to lift it free from the sucking mud and carried it out of the hole. They all looked very pleased with themselves as they stretched and flexed the parts of their bodies that hurt from the effort.

Cryptum Effingis hovered between them, greeting them,occasionally colliding with arms or behinds, enjoying getting the hang of maneuvering, getting the feel for the controls. It was starting to feel quite natural.

The rear land boat loaded back up, the students went to help their colleagues at the front. With most of them lifting, together they made short work of rescuing it from the hole. Breatsch Manty didn't seem to be doing much lifting, but was marching around barking advice that sounded like orders which, if followed at all, was likely only because it was what the people they were directed at were doing anyway.

Now he knew nobody was hurt, Cryptum Effingis found it all quite entertaining.

Breatsch T'Lin was worried about the schedule. If this took much longer, the group would have hardly any time at the settlement before they would need to turn around and come back. And she was concerned about their ability to pass back this way, with the giant hole in the path. Effingis didn't know why Breatsch T'Lin worried so much.

He took the drone around the edge of the chaos and down the path a little way. He thought it was probably worth scouting ahead to see if there were likely to be any more sinkholes, or other surprises. Effingis played with the different sensors on the drone, overlaying heat imaging data, ultraviolet, radiation levels, on top of the visuals he had.

He passed along a slight bend in the path so the students and their land boats were out of sight, hidden by trees when he looked back. He flicked the heat imaging on, and saw them moving around, although there seemed to be plenty in the trees in between that generated as much heat as a human body, as well. The noise they were making had become immediately muffled, as well.

He had decided, based on the fact that no other beings, Nemtan or otherwise, had shown up to claim their victims, that this wasn't a trap after all.

Effingis paused for a moment, hovering at roughly what his own head height would be if he had been standing there in person, and just took everything in.

The jungle on either side of the path seemed to be both still and in constant agitation simultaneously. It radiated peace and harmony in a way that nothing on the Daracrin ever had. But there was always something moving. Leaves rustled in a breeze that Effingis could measure but not feel. Strange fruit detached themselves from branches and tumbled into the undergrowth. Fluttering or buzzing creatures darted around between flower heads. Water which had accumulated in the canopy became suddenly too much and spilled to the ground. Unseen birds twitted and cooed, stirring leaves in their wake.

Effingis watched in delight and awe as a cluster of leaves or petals - he couldn't tell which - moved ever so slowly on their stem, turning the head of the plant to point in a different direction, pulled by some invisible force.

"It's the gas giant," said Breatsch T'Lin, noticing on her own screen that Effingis had been staring at the plant for several minutes, then replaying the footage on triple speed to confirm he had just seen what the thought he had.

"Huh? What?"

"The plant is tracking the other planet in the system, look," she did something on her own screen that activated a visualisation of the bodies that would have been visible in the sky if it had been dark enough. It was enhanced with a line between the marker for the gas giant, and the plant, and some equation hovered by it to demonstrate, Effingis supposed, that the trajectory between them was consistent.

"I wonder why," T'Lin mused. THen she started. "Did you hear that?"

"Hear what?" Effingis played back the audio from the last few seconds.

"There," she said, replaying again. "That sounded like speech."

Cryptum Effingis listened, squinting as if that would help. He heard only the jungle sounds.

"Probably just the students behind-"

"No, not our speech, _their_ speech. Nemtan speech."

Effingis replayed again. There was a low trilling sound he could just make out over everything else, that he had taken for a bird before, that could have been...

"It was, uh, a question. Expressing curiosity." T'Lin switched them back to the realtime feed.

"I didn't realise you had been learning how to-"

"Hang on, there's a weight warning," she spun an alert dialogue into the corner of Effingis's view. "There's something sitting on top of the drone."

The view wobbled as the drone bobbed slightly, but it quickly corrected for whatever had landed on top.

"Don't these things have some sort of self-defense built in?"

"They're not exactly built for combat, Cryptum," said T'Lin, who had only ever read about combat. "Try spinning around."

He did.

"Faster?"

There were more sounds now, close to the microphone on the drone. A squealing, and then something a lot like laughter? Effingis stopped spinning.

A shape appeared in the middle of Effingis's view, taking up most of it. He refocused and it took both of them a minute of adjusting their perspective to realise they were looking at a face. An upside down one.

Effingis lowered the drone gently down, as low as possible to get it to the ground, without making contact. The owner of the face hopped down and stood, upright, on two legs, with two arms by its sides, looking the drone up and down thoughtfully. Effingis zoomed in.

It had dark brown skin, a perfectly ordinary shade, but its face seemed to be covered in - or made up of - something across between leaves and scales. They shimmered ever so slightly when it moved. What Effingis had initially taken for hair in a series of little bunches all over the top of its head seemed on closer inspection to be some kind of stubby wooden nodules. It had ears, eyes - dark and penetrating - nose and mouth, all in the normal proportions. Its nose was a little upturned, and it had a small dimple in its chin. Its limbs were the same proportions as a normal human toddler. It twiddled its pudgy fingers, sometimes putting them into its mouth or hooking them into the little pocket on the front of the soft beige dungarees like thing it was wearing.

The creature giggled - unmistakably - and clapped its little hands together.

T'Lin laughed as well. "Quite cute, aren't they?"

Effingis scowled. He had never had much to do with any of the young children raised on the Daracrin. They were enough of a handful when they came to him as assistants or students.

Without warning, the baby Nemtan launched itself at the drone, reaching most of the way up in one hop, then clambering the rest of the way up with hands and bare feet. Effingis was surprised it could get enough of a grip on the slick metal casing.

"Now what?" He turned to Breatsch T'Lin.

"Listen," she said, cocking her head. "It's saying something."

Effingis didn't have much of an aptitude for language, so he hadn't made any effort to study the Nemtan dialect when they arrived. Ostensibly it had the same roots as Teprime, and some people claimed they could clearly hear its resemblance to Old Neme, from which Teprime had developed, base don the ancient records that had survived the exodus. But it was totally unfamiliar to Cryptum Effingis. They might as well be making animal sounds.

T'Lin laughed again. "They're saying 'go'," she grinned. "I think they want a ride."

"Is that a good idea?"

Breatsch T'Lin shrugged. "I don't see the harm. Go slow."

Effingis rolled his eyes. He was not out here to be come a play thing. He drifted the drone slowly forwards.

The child slapped the sides of the drone a few times and jiggled, repeating the sound that T'Lin said meant 'go'. Effingis refused to speed up, and before long the child seemed to just vanish. T'Lin deduced that it had hopped vertically and caught a low-hanging tree branch, disappearing back into the jungle.

Moments later Cryptum Effingis and Breatsch T'Lin both received messages on their palm screens.

"Better head back," said T'Lin, and Effingis spun the drone around.

--------

The Nemtans' settlement, or _maurauna_ as everybody seemed to be calling it, was barely distinguishable from the surrounding jungle. There were more open spaces, but any sorts of dwelling places or structures appeared at first glance to be fallen trees, hollow stumps, large bushes, or piles of leaves. The Nemtans were everywhere, though, in all their shapes and sizes and colours.

The remainder of the journey by land boat had passed without incident, though they had incurred a significant time delay.

The students split off into their three groups to pursue their chosen investigations. Effingis shadowed Breatsch Amba, listening carefully with T'Lin to do occasional interpretation by his side, and looking out for signs that anyone other than the Nemtans might be present.

——–

The group of four students: Breatsch Amba Daracrin a-Zeloa, Breatsch Jacqain Daracrin a-Uisir, Breatsch Mevvin Daracrin a-Yei and Breatsch Ilucia Daracrin a-Zeloa sat in a circle on soft grass in a small clearing. It was quiet; the trees surrounded them thickly, narrow trunks close together, and covered with a fuzzy moss-like growth which further muted the sound. The drone hovered just outside of the circle, between Breatsch Amba and Breatsch Jacqain.

A tall, greenish-grey Nemtan had brought them all here, after hearing Amba's questions, bid them to sit and promised them something that T'Lin hadn't caught well enough to be able to translate for Cryptum Effingis. Amba and the others had seemed happy enough, though.

Something about the place kept their silence. Even the ordinary jungle sounds were distant here.

Effingis wondered how far they were from the settlement. It seemed like they had walked and talked with the Nemtan for quite some time, but Effingis had been too busy absorbing the details of the scenery to pay attention to the route or direction they had taken.

He muted the drone, and asked the question to T'Lin.

"We walked for three quarters of an hour from _maurauna_. We're about five and a half kloms from there, line of sight, but we followed a fairly winding and indirect route. We were walking slowly though; I think we could return in less than half an hour if we needed to."

"Thanks. Breatsch, you know your rotation is over if you want to leave? Breatsch Arauga should be due to take over from you."

T'Lin blushed a little. "I'm very interested, Cryptum... If it's alirght with you of course, I'd like to stay."

Cryptum Effingis shrugged and tried to look indifferent, but he was glad. He enjoyed T'Lin's academic interest in his work. And Breatsch Arauga talked too much.

"Thank you Cryptum. I'll let Breatsch Arauga know and we can arrange to swap a rotation on another day." She had already done that half an hour prior, of course.

Some time later, Breatsch Mevvin broke the silence.

"Do you think they're coming back?" She spoke in a high pitched voice that sounded perpetually on the verge of panic. Her wide, pale eyes did nothing to dispel that, either.

"Maybe they had to go all the way back to _maurauna_ to get the elders?"

"Even if not all the way, perhaps they have to travel more slowly."

"I wonder why we couldn't just go with them."

"Yeah I assumed they were around the corner or something."

"Maybe they just wanted us out of the way for a bit."

"That was a very convincing explanation if so."

Effingis noticed that T'Lin was scanning the area for signs of people nearby. She found none.

Effingis's palm screen buzzed. A note from Breatsch Manty to say that due to the earlier delay, he had taken it upon himself to make arrangements for them all to stay in the settlement until the next day. By the looks of things, the students in the circle had all received the message too. Their reactions ranged from excited to disgruntled.

"I might want to be in my own _pod_ tonight," grumbled Breatsch Jacqain. "Could at least have asked us."

"Oh don't be ridiculous," said Breatsch Ilucia. "You know we either all have to go, or we all stay. If it came to a vote we're certainly all staying."

"Let's just make the most of it," said Amba. "It just means we can wait longer here without worrying about getting back."

Two and a half hours later, Mevvin and Ilucia had fallen asleep, Amba and Jacqain were meditating, and Effingis was catching up on sheafwork, with half an eye on the view from the drone on a surface pad.

He had insisted that T'Lin take a break - she had her own studies to attend to after all - but she had made him promise to buzz her as soon as anything interesting happened.

The four students' palm screens buzzed.

"They're feeding everyone in _maurauna_," said Amba. "I guess we'll head back. Wake up you two."

The students yawned and stretched and gathered themselves. Effingis put the wraparound screen back on.

"Well, figure anything out?" He asked Amba via the drone.

"Either they're forgetful, or very slow, or I completely misunderstood the situation here," she said. "There's something about this place. It feels like... the veil is thin, you know? We're close to something more."

"Perhaps, Breatsch, they were trying to tell you that they keep their stories in the trees, the jungle holds their memories."

"Hmm," said Amba, giving his comment consideration, even though she knew the Cryptum wasn't being serious. "It's possible they have ancestral memory connected with the land... It's not all that far from the Volt."

"The Volt is a computer," said Ilucia. "It has circuitry. This," he spread his palms wide, "is wilderness."

"Maybe they will tell us some myths later," Mevvin chimed in. "I hope they do."

The Nemtans seemed to delight in the meal. There was a party atmosphere, as a variety of dishes were brought out for the students to sample. They were nothing like what they had been used to eating. A range of textures and tastes and colours that most of them would never have associated with food. Effingis watched, slightly jealously, through the drone while he ate his own bowl of hot reconstituted bean soup.

The hydroponics lab on Newland Outpost Three was doing well, apparently, but it was still some weeks away from producing enough for wide distribution.

Most of the dishes the Nemtans shared were raw, sprouted, or fermented; nothing cooked. The group had brought their own food for the day, and tried to share it with the Nemtans, but only the youngest children seemed interested.

"Well our food isn't nearly as tasty as theirs," said Breatsch Vissingis, happily munching on slices of crisp fruit which he smeared with a different spread or pickle each time. "Have you tried this red paste? It's cosmic."

"Do they have recipes? How do we ask for recipes?"

"What are these crispy things, is it dried fruit? It tastes like the sea."

"How do you know what the sea tastes like? Here, try these red berries..."

"I was at Outpost Two for the first few weeks after we arrived, actually..."

"Put this sauce on these leaves, can you believe it?"

"Oh! This is sweet! It's like eating a cloud!"

"Can you pass me those little mushroom things?"

"That's a great idea, wrapping it up in the leaves. Look the Nemtan kids are copying you."

The locals didn't seem to eat much, but they ate with relish. The meal took place sitting on the floor in a sprawling crowd, with plates and bowls passed around from hand to hand, rarely being put down on the ground for more than a moment. Some Nemtans ate everything by hand, wet and dry, and others had their own personal little scoops which they dipped into anything they liked; heedless of cross-contaminating the different foods. THe students followed suit, as they preferred. There was always fruit juice to drink, and sometimes water. Breatsch Amba related a report she had read from one of the early contact groups to the settlement who had been met with complete confusion when they asked for water the first time. They never saw the Nemtans drink it.

Effingis had finished his soup and was chewing on a protein bar, thinking he might ask them just to let him know when they were back at work, when he spotted a creature on the edge of the clearing. He zoomed in.

It was over a head taller than most of the Nemtans and its skin was a shade of deep read like Effingis had never seen before. It had four arms and a tail. Surely this was it! The outsider he'd been waiting for. He put the wraparound headset back on, and watched carefully.

The creature interacted with the Nemtans as if it was one of them, seating itself and taking a few pieces of food. _Politeness_, thought Effingis. _It isn't eating much._ He thought for a moment, then sent a message to Breatsch Amba. He didn't want to alarm the newcomer by taking the drone straight over, especially if it was a more technologically advanced alien, but sending a student in for a chat shouldn't raise any suspicions.

——–

"Okay, I've confirmed, they definitely think it's weird that we're eating so much."

"Are they upset? Are we using their supplies?"

"Definitely didn't get that impression. More like it's funny?"

"But also they kind of don't understand it."

"I read something once about an animal on Tepremen that ate almost nothing for some seasons, and lots in other seasons. Maybe they're like that, and to them we're eating out of season."

Effingis was half listening to the conversation between Jacqain, Mevvin and Vissingis, but was watching intently as Breatsch Amba and Breatsch Ilucia skirted the edge of the crowd to approach the tall red creatures.

He saw them talking to the Nemtans nearby, pointing at food, miming where language failed them. Then they sat with the group close to the red one but without making direct contact. Yet. _Good strategy_, thought Effingis.

———

"As far as we can tell, they are ordinary Nemtans," said Breatsch Ilucia. "Just, you know, tall."

"It has four arms!" Screeched Effingis through the drone.

"And fur and a tail," Amba pointed out.

"It matches reports from Outpost Four," said T'Lin to Effingis. "They've seen many like this living on the edge of the desert. It must be a particular adaptation."

"I think they're happy to talk to us more tomorrow, Cryptum," said Amba. "Tell us more about where they're form."

Effingis shrugged angrily, though only Breatsch T'Lin got to see it. "Do as you like," he said. "We'll get to the bottom of this eventually."

"Ask Breatsch Amba if she found out why we got abandoned in the jungle," suggested T'Lin. Effingis repeated the question.

Amba shrugged. "I couldn't figure it out. Definitely missing something. They seemed to think we should have met someone, I think. They were confused that we hadn't. I'm not sure they understood what I was saying."

Breatsch T'Mala came rushing over. "Amba, Cryptum," he nodded breathlessly at the drone. "Breatsch Manty says to tel you we've found one who can speak our language. They've just returned from the coast and spent time at Outpost Two."

Effingis had a message from Manty, saying as much. That might be useful. He thought of Dneel's proposed project. "Does it live here?" He asked.

T'Mala nodded. "Uh, I think so yeah. Or at least they're staying for a while. Tiny wiry thing, not much bigger than a child."

"If we can, let's make sure each group has a chance to talk with it. But don't overdo it. And Breatsch Amba, perhaps you can get some help with your miscommunication problem."

"Yes Cryptum." The students dispersed. The sky started to darken as the extra nighttime that so rudely interrupted the day began.

Life in _maurauna_ seemed to continue as usual. The group concluded the Nemtans must be able to see in the dark. T'Lin was quickly able to provide several citations from recent weeks to reinforce this.

----------

* * *

Cryptum Effingis was with Breatsch Amba, Breatsch Demron and Freilum Kiv testing the telepresecne robot they would send out with the next the field expedition when the news came that Cryptum Merrik had died.

Effingis grunted, like he was still preoccupied with something else. The others stopped what they were doing and looked at him.

"If you need a break-"

"We can finish-"

"Are you okay?"

"Huh?" Effingis looked from one to the other of the faces in front of him. They wore very concerned expressions. "Yes, of course I'm okay. He was very old, this is not unexpected. Life goes on."

"Cryptum, if you'll excuse me," said Freilum Lungis, the messenger who had brought the unfortunate news. "We'll need to discuss the send off, and ah, redistributing some of Cryptum Merrik's more urgent responsibilities. It's all planned in of course, but we'll need to formally transfer access..."

Gradually it dawned on Effingis that he was now the only Cryptum from Daracrin left. Merrik had been older than him, but not by much. Merrik had had his responsibilities as department head and director of research not due to his age, but because he was good at managing people. Except there had to be at least one representative from each generation and each ship on several of the oversight committees. And regardless of his abilities, that left Cryptum Effingis as the only qualified candidate.

It also left him as a kind of figurehead for the Breatsch students of Daracrin. They already admired him more than he was comfortable with, despite his best efforts to keep them at arms length.

"You know what," he interrupted Feilum Lingis. "I will take a break. Fr. Lingis, please send the list of thing I'm needed for to my assistant. I'll be in my pod."

---------

* * *

They had to adapt the Ceremony for the Departed a little for life planetside, compared to how it had been on Daracrin. Everyone at Newland Outpust Three attended, and all of the other outposts, as well as Newland itself and the Ripnorth, received broadcast audio. Cryptum Merrik was far from the first planetside death, but it was the first of an elder, and the arrangements reflected the pomp and circumstance befitting of such a senior member of the faculty and community.

The core of the ceremony was the committment of Cryptum Merrik's knowledge to the Volt. It was in some sense a promise of eternal life, as a digital image. All of Merrik's memories, experiences, opinions, emotions, would be extracted from his crani-state snapshots and streamed into the Volt. While the architecture of the Volt was much more complex than that of the ordinary data storage systems, including the central databases, there were interfaces in daily use which let people access knowledge and insight from the Volt in much the same way.

But beyond that, nobody was really sure what life was like for those inside. Cryptum Effingis was quite convinced that the personality was so thoroughly disintegrated as part of the transfer process that no self-aware entity could possibly remain at the end of it. Others believed that life in the Volt went on, that their friends and ancestors whose physical bodies gave up continued to live on in a virtual reality in the depths of the Volt, on hardware so complex that other computer programs written with today's technology stood no chance of accessing it.

The Volt was old technology. Cryptum Effingis secretly hoped that the answer to how it worked might lay here, on the planet of their origin.

The Volt Fragment loomed above him. Effingis didn't normally attribute intent to objects, but the black slab, twice as tall as he was, seemed menacing all of a sudden. Its surface was perfectly smooth to the touch, but close inspection revealed miniscule veins running all over it in a maze of scribble. The lines appeared to be etched into the surface in intricate relief but couldn't be felt by anyone's skin. Either they were too fine to detect, or they existed a micron between a transparent surface layer; no-one knew for sure. The substance of the Volt hardware remained stubbornly impenetrable to any scans that had yet been devised.

Effingis had found out after they arrived that research teams on K'Bel had been dedicated to this problem for some hundreds of years, and besides coming up with yet more ways to interface with the data in the thing, had got essentially nowhere.

His hand hovered over the digital pad held out by Freilum Evni. She looked at him with sympathetic grey eyes, wide and watery, and waited.

Effingis' stomach churned. The pad had been configured and all he needed to do was press the button. Could he condemn his oldest colleague to this irreversible fate? But Merrik was already gone, there was nothing to be lost. Unless a discovery was made that allowed access to the crani-state without the Volt. Unless Merrik really would be preserved and his whole self would pass into the screaming chaotic void of the computer system, never able to escape. What if the Volt was endless torment? Some believed it might be. Cryptum Merrik hadn't, but...

Evni cleared her throat, softly. Probably only Effingis would have heard it.

He lowered his hand a little, and then faltered again. He wondered who would be committing _his_ mind to the Volt when the time came.

It was everyone's duty to join the Volt. To share their lifetime of experiences with the future generations.

He pressed the button.

* * *

Cryptum Effingis entered the meeting room and took his usual seat against the back wall, away from the large oval table. It was quieter than usual as the various section, institute and department heads filed in; they scraped chairs, shuffled sheaves, tapped at palm or surface screens, but didn't chatter or mutter like they normally did.

He had been absorbed in a report about unusual activity in Nemta's planetary system that Breatsch T'Lin had found for him, on his palm screen, but eventually became aware that several peoples' attention seemed to be fixed on him. He looked up begrudgingly.

"Cryptum," said Freilum Dunai, gently. "Please would you take your seat at the table?"

There was one empty seat, with a small laser-engraved plex sign reading "Cryptum of Daracrin". For a moment, Effingis's memory projected Cryptum Merrik's face into the space, and then he remembered.

"Yes," he grunted, standing slowly, achingly. "Of course."

Freilum Dunai Elmneth a-Teprem chaired the meeting, calling for reports from each section about how their work was proceeding. A large timeline was projected over the center of the table, detailing the phases of work over the next ten local years. It zoomed in to detail for phases or projects when needed, and highlighted things in red or green as each section reported in. Effingis didn't know who was controlling it. He had never paid it much attention before, but it was hard to ignore from his table seat.

There was a stool behind his seat, away from the table. The other generations and ship representatives, except for the Breatsch, had assistants perched on their stools, tapping away at palm screens and occasionally conferring in hushed whispers. Effingis couldn't help but feel a bit lost, the emptiness of the stool a glaring weakness. He thought about sending a message to summon Breatsch T'Lin, but doing that halfway through the meeting felt like defeat, admitting he had come unprepared and couldn't manage. He wrestled his conflicting anxieties for a while, before being pulled back to the present with a direct address: "Well, Cryptum Effingis Daracrin, any questions?"

"No questions," he muttered, silently resolving to start paying attention.

Freilum Dunai continued around the table, registering questions that any of the representatives had on whatever the report was that had just been presented, and also recording who had had none.

Cryptum Effingis managed to find the report they were discussing on the surface screen in front of him - in more time than it would have taken Breatsch T'Lin to be sure - and started to skim it. He had the distinct impression everyone else had read the document before coming into the meeting, and had prepared their questions in advance.

Effingis was no stranger to preparing properly for meetings. He had been a very efficient worker in his time, supervised hundreds of students, coordinated dozens of large scale cross-institute projects... He just wasn't used to having to do so for _this_meeting, and the scale and pace of the things that were happening planetside put his decades of research oversight to shame.

And yet, he must have something to bring to all this. Some insight from his experience he could share with the surprisingly young looking Freilum and Breatsch.

The report was from the Construction Section, on the Second Cohort's work of laying the foundations for a permanent settlement - the city of Newland - as close as possible to the last known location of their ancestors in Rasch a-Lurniq.

The team had identified a need to work with the Historical Section, who were in the process of forming and training an Institute of Archaeology, because they had come across old city remains unexpectedly in their build location. The conversation now seemed to be about setting that up.

Effingis pulled up a diagram of the various departments, institutes, sections and cohorts, then closed it again. It was a complex mess of overlapping boxes and lines. With the students he had only needed to worry about their institutes; he had operated in the Pedagogy Section for his whole life, and never had to think about the messy reality outside of that before.

* * *

* * *

The room was dimly lit, flickering in the soft glow of an artificial candle. Effingis tried to recall where he was and why he was here, but could not. It didn't seem to matter. A shape moved at the other end of the room and he knew it was his old friend, Cryptum Elshwynn Daracrin an-Imtux. He tried to stand but realised he was already standing. He moved to take a step, then she was by his side, suddenly, holding his hand. He looked down at their fingers clasped together and almost didn't recognise his own. The skin was smooth, the knuckles unswollen, the hairs soft and dark instead of coarse and grey. Her skin was smooth too, long elegant fingers a shade or two lighter than his own. For some reason he couldn't see her face - it was cast in shadow, or his eyes were closed - but felt her breath on his cheek. She pressed her body against his, and he was sure he should be feeling something, but there was nothing, except a slight and unpleasant flutter of panic in his chest. Her face was even closer now, and he searched in himself for a spark, anything, but came up blank. His mouth was dry, a bad taste. Then her lips on his and loved her of course like he loved all of his friends, and he wanted to make her laugh and support her in hard times but he didn't want _this_, didn't want to touch her like this, didn't want her to use his body this way.

He pushed her gently away, then awoke with a start.

Effingis's heart was pounding. He rolled over in his pod and felt something cold on the pillow. He wiped the tears from his cheeks with the palms of his hands. The dream had been raw, vivid, like a replay of a crani-state log. It wasn't one he'd had before though, and wasn't a memory either. More like a composite of scenes and feelings over the course of years.

Cryptum Elshwynn had died twenty years ago of Regnies Disease, a years-delayed after effect of the radiation leak of year 484. Before then, she had conceived with Cryptum Marabas Daracrin a-Teprem. That was all she had ever wanted: to carry her particular genes on, to send them forward to the new world.

Effingis didn't think Elshwynn's child had been birthed even yet. It would likely be one of the first generation to start their lives on the planet. The a-Nemta generation. The generation that his measly selfish clinging to life was preventing from coming into existence at all.

* * *

Cryptum Effingis Daracrin a-Teprem walked around the balcony that circled Newland Outpost Three. He was on his fifth lap. His knees ached, his back ached, his head ached. Sometimes he had to grasp the railing, breathing hard.

The sun had set. He thought it hadn't been long since, but it seemed very dark all of a sudden. Clouds blotted the stars in places. The moon was bright enough to cast shadows until, every now and again, a cloud swallowed it whole. There was a breeze, but it was warm. It licked at the sweat on his head and neck. The river rumbled, eternal, below.

Earlier that day, Effingis had been down to see the Volt Fragment. The one they had brought up for Cryptum Merrik's Departure Ceremony normally lived at the lowest level of Newland Outpost Three, underneath the river.

It had a room of its own, right below the transport dock. Someone disembarking could walk to the center of the bay and look through a transparent section of floor to see the giant black slab right underneath them. When they needed to move the Fragment, that transparent window turned into an open hatch, and the Fragment was raised up with pulleys. From the dock it could be taken anywhere.

Effingis had stood by it for most of the afternoon. He was sure he could hear the whispers of the people stored inside. They got louder when he moved closer, but stopped when he touched it.

Effingis hadn't made a crani-state snapshot for weeks. Not since T'Lin left. The reminders she had set up for him still went off, but they didn't seem to work without her there to nudge. They were easy to ignore.

If he was uploaded to the Volt now, it would be without a record of those weeks. That would be for the best. They had not been good weeks.

Lap six. He was starting to feel dizzy. He couldn't remember when he had eaten last.

He was supposed to have been in a meeting between the Pedagogy Section and the newly formed Institute of Archaeology that afternoon, not staring at the Volt Fragment. He had lied to them, and told them he was not well. Perhaps it wasn't a lie. He had considered just not going, but someone would have come to find him. Nowhere to hide in this place. Better that they think he was asleep in his pod.

His breath was coming short. He stopped and leaned on the railings. The view down was to almost pure darkness. He could hear the river crashing, and his brain filled in images of the churning waves, foaming against the rocks and the struts of the Outpost from the flecks of white or flashed and choppy reflections of the moon on the rippling water. Every so often a beam of yellow light would leak through as the bay doors opened for a departing or returning transport, bringing the distance to the water into brief, vivid focus.

Cryptum Effingis leaned forward over the railing, captivated by the sound of the water. The metal bar pressed cold and hard into his chest. The whispering was down there. He could hear the Volt Fragment, even from up here, even over the river.

_In the way._

The words came to him. From the Volt Fragment, or his own head? Soon they would be the same thing.

_Get out of the way._

He put one foot into the lower bar of the railing and lifted himself off the floor. The upper bar pressed against his groin as he leaned forwards more, trying to make out the words.

_GET OUT OF THE WAY._

He realised with a jolt that these weren't the voices of the past, coming from the Volt Fragment. These were the voices of the future. Coming from where? Who knew. Maybe the jungle. It didn't matter. What mattered was they weren't alive yet because of him. Well, he knew how to fix that, at least.

He closed his eyes and didn't see the water rushing to meet him.

* * *

Cryptum Effingis awoke to the comforting pinkish orange light of a medical pod. He was no stranger to it. He had spent a couple of years in or beside one when the Daracrin had been seriously damaged by high speed debris passing from the Yei to the Trascant regions of space. Their technology had improved a lot since then, but the form was still the same.

He remembered the balcony and the night and the railing and the river quite clearly, and wondered resignedly how they had got him back from that one.

Unless this was what the Volt felt like?

No, had to be the physical, the Volt wouldn't have those memories.

No part of his body hurt, which meant he must be pretty dosed up on painkillers. He didn't feel too terribly upset about the situation, either.

Through the translucent, misted, warm toned- door of the medipod he could see figures moving about. He knew they'd have been alerted straight away to his regaining consciousness and waited in anticipation for the medipod to open.

The first face he saw was Freilum Anmorth Vansage a-Teprem, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer.

"Pod duties are a bit below your station, aren't they?" Effingis chuckled, or at least tried to. He wasn't convinced his lips and tongue had moved quite the way he wanted them to.

"A bit slurred still, Cryptum, but don't worry," said Anmorth. He sounded friendly but looked severe, with a thin, tight face, and dark eyes contrasting his pale skin. Cryptum Effingis had always struggled to tell whether the man was happy or sad; amused or angry. "We'll have you back up and running soon. You're pleased to see me, I take it? I'll bet. You took quite a fall. There are some people here to see you."

Cryptum Effingis tried to set up, but his body didn't seem interested in helping out. Freilum Anmorth stepped out of view, and Effingis's least favourite assistants, Breatsch Arauga and Breatsch Domnal stood timidly to the side of the pod.

"Morning Cryptum," said Aurauga brightly, but his too-high-pitched laugh betrayed his nervousness. "How're you feeling in there?"

Breatsch Donmal twisted her fingers around her long plait and shuffled from one foot to the other.

Someone else stepped into his field of vision. He squinted, not sure if he had started hallucinating from whatever drugs they had filled his system with. It was Breatsch T'Lin.

She raised a hand in the silent greeting of the shy, and looked at the floor.

Breatsch Amba and Breatsch Ilucia jostled in beside her. They were out of breath.

"We just heard you were awake, Cryptum! We were so worried-"

"My friend is on the team investigating the railing stability to make sure this doesn't hap-"

"He doesn't want to hear about that right now, he can hardly sit. I've buzzed the rest of the group, Cryptum, everyone else should be here soon..."

More and more of his students arrived, filling up the room around the medical pod and chattering, to each other or to him, he couldn't tell. There was a tension in the air that he couldn't place. An solemnity that was somehow electric, like everyone was short on sleep and running on adrenaline. He thought he might have got control of his voice at last, but it didn't seem like he would get an opportunity to use it. Effingis lost sight of Breatsch T'Lin.

Before long, Anmorth showed back up and shooed the students out.

"Sorry about that," he spoke to Effingis with his back turned, clattering with something on the side. "The tall one said she was calling for a couple of others, I didn't realise she was bringing a whole cohort down on you. Let me know if there's anyone you want to see in particular, won't you? We should have you out of here in a few days."

Effingis managed to prop himself up on his elbows so he could see over the sides of the medipod, and cleared his throat.

"How long have I been in here?" His voice was a rasp at first. Anmorth held out a small cup of water for him to sip.

"Six days local," said the medical officer. "Not bad, considering."

"And how is it that you're my nurse?"

Anmorth smiled his thin-lipped ambiguous smile. "Not for fun and games, unfortunately. Three days ago there was a chemical explosion at Outpost Two. Something in the sea bed they weren't expecting. We're down to a skeleton crew here as the rest of the medical staff have shipped off to help out. I was here on my tour of the Outposts, so I've been drafted in. I'd just get in the way on the front lines. People worry too much about looking good in front of me."

Cryptum Effingis slumped back down onto his back as his elbows started to go numb with his weight. He had nothing to say to that. The only person he really knew well at Outpost Two had been Breatsch T'Lin, and she was obviously safe back here, so there was nobody to ask after.

"Want me to sit you up? You'll be able to have something to eat tomorrow."

Effingis shook his head. "I'll sleep," he sighed. "But tomorrow - please ask Breatsch T'Lin, my old assistant, if she will come."

-------------

Breatsch T'Lin came. She was sitting by his side when he woke up, reading something on her palm screen. She looked up when she heard him move. She didn't smile.

Cryptum Effingis sighed. "Please could you sit me up?"

She must have tapped into the medical pod controls from her palm screen, because she didn't move, but the cushioning inside the pod started to shift around to lift his back. There was a cup of water on the side, but T'Lin made no move to hand it to him. When he was upright, Effingis reached for hit himself, and drained it.

"Thank you for coming back," he started, haltingly.

"There was nothing wrong with the railings," she said, voice barely above a whisper.

"They uh. They finished the investigation?"

"No, no doubt they'll investigate until they find something to blame. I know there was nothing wrong with them." The words were choked out, like they had to be ripped from her throat.

Cryptum Effingis was silent. Breatsch T'Lin was still looking at her screen, not up at him. Effingis still held the cup, his arm resting on the side of the pod. Her palm screen rested in her lap, and her hands were balled into fists.

Finally T'Lin raised her head; there were tears in her eyes. Effingis felt his own eyes start to burn. He hadn't felt that in many years.

"What happened?" He whispered. "Breatsch Dneel...?"

T'Lin sniffed and took a deep breath. "Dneel is fine. She was lucky, away on a field trip at the islands when it happened. She's helping with the recovery. Thought she was needed more there than here."

"What happened?" He asked again. "How many people...?"

"A thousand? More? They're still finding people. I don't know."

Cryptum Effingis gaped.

"Outpost Two is destroyed. It's gone, I think, half sunk at least. They'll rebuild it, but."

"Who have you lost?"

"I don't know!" Breatsch T'Lin sounded angry. "I haven't looked at the lists. I'm not going to. I can't deal with..." she trailed off.

Effingis thought of her, sitting by his medipod, in this place that was no longer her home, hearing snippets of news of the disaster, waiting for him to wake up, not knowing if he would; waiting to find out if she had a home to go back to, not knowing if she did.

"I'm sorry," he said softly.

She shrugged. "It happened. We move forward. It won't be the last disaster."

She sounded like an aging spacer, a hundred year old who had seen it all. Effingis felt for a moment like he was looking in a mirror.

Breatsch Aurauga turned up, to tell Effingis that the investigation into the railings was still ongoing, but they hadn't worked out what went wrong yet. Freilum Anmorth came by to bring him a thin porridge, and stayed to make sure he ate it all. Breatsch Manty and Breatsch Amba visited to update him on the progress of their projects, and Breatsch Vissingis arrived to share a report about how the Nemtans were aiding Newland Outpost Two with their rescue operations. The students seemed to relish having his undivided attention again. Freilum Turmwald from the Planning and Recovery Institute popped in to ask his opinion on forming a new cohort for disaster response. All the while, T'Lin haunted the corners of the room like a ghost. Like she had nowhere else to go.

Effingis answered them on autopilot, listlessly, distractedly.

_There was nothing wrong with the railings._

_Get out of the way._

He went back to sleep. He wasn't sure if T'Lin was still there, or if she had left.

* * *

The Departure Ceremony for the thirteen hundred and forty six people lost as a result of the explosion at Newland Outpost Two took place five days later.

Effingis's legs were slow to recover. There was nothing else the medical pod could do for him; the rest of the healing was up to his body. He wasn't sure he was up for it. Breatsch Domnal had helped him into a wheelchair and pushed him to the central gallery, where everyone had gathered to listen to the audio of the ceremony at Outpost Two.

Breatsch T'Lin had heard or assumed overstated estimates of the amount of damage to the structure of the Outpost. A strut had collapsed, lower levels had flooded, and about a fifth of the building had fallen into the sea, but it was by no means completely destroyed. It had been stabilised, and the survivors and people from other Outposts flown in to help had gathered in the largest docking bay for the Ceremony.

Breatsch T'Lin could have gone back, but she hadn't. She seemed to be waiting for something. She stood beside him during the ceremony, a hand resting on the top of his chair. Cryptum Effingis tried to listen as people took it in turns to read out the names of those who had died, but it started to sound like a rush of water instead of words.

Five Cryptums had been lost, three from Vansage, one from K'Bel and one from Elmneth. There were no more on other outposts, or on Ripnoth, from Vansage or K'Bel. There was a significance to this. A generation concluded. The Vansage and K'Bel ship councils would meet at some point in the next few days, and formally agree to birth a new generation, the first to be born on a planet in over five hundred years. The Population Section would already be preparing. The stored embryos were on Ripnorth, and would be brought to the planet in batches. The Population Section's nurseries had been reconstructed in Newland itself, one of the first permanent buildings to be erected. They would be more than ready by now.

They would need more than two ships worth, to replace those lost, to survive on this planet, Effingis thought. They would need to stop waiting for the previous generation to die out, too.

Some things had changed very quickly since their arrival here. His Breatsch students seemed to have taken to life planetside as if it was natural to them, as if they belonged here. Structures had been erected, theories confirmed or confounded, questions answered and endless new questions asked. The populations of the different ships mixing as if they had known each other their whole lives, as if they were old friends coming back together, not vague rumours of long lost counterparts, blips on a radar, faceless neighbours from lightyears away.

Other things had not evolved, and it wasn't clear they were going to. Despite everything, the Population Section had seen no reason to change its policies or processes to speed up the introduction of new life to their community.

* * *

Cryptum Effingis decided to make a crani-state snapshot. The medical pod had done one automatically when he was placed inside after being rescued from the river, but there was something unconvincing about not being conscious for it.

He was having trouble raising his arms all the way - they were stiff, like his joints were seizing up - so Breatsch T'Lin helped him fit the pads to his temples. The indicator on his palm screen glowed: yellow to say it was scanning, then violet when it had finished.

Breatsch T'Lin hadn't been talking much, these past few days. Mostly Effingis assumed it was because Breatsch Aurauga was around, who rarely let anyone else get a word in edgeways. But they had been alone all morning, and still she said nothing.

"I'm sorry," Cryptum Effingis said. "Breatsch T'Lin. For driving you away. I know it's my fault you left. I'm sorry. And now, you're back. But you should be with Breatsch Dneel. Please don't stay here on my account."

Breatsch T'Lin burst into tears.

Effingis reached out to take her hand. He didn't know what else to do.

Breatsch T'Lin sobbed for a few minutes, muffling the sound with her hands, trying and failing to hold each and every one back. Gradually, they subsided.

"It's not your fault we left. Well mostly not."

"What?"

"So please don't blame yourself. For us being at Outpost Two."

"Then why?"

"Dneel had an opportunity from a colleague from Vansage. They needed more field researchers who could speak the Nemtan language. So they were taking level ones. It was too good a chance to miss."

"And you?"

"There was a rumour that they might open a new genetics research lab. Just a rumour, but Dneel wanted to go for sure, and I. I was so angry with you." T'Lin looked down at her hands. "You just disappeared on us."

"Did you get in? To genetics?"

Breatsch T'Lin nodded. "It was really good," she laughed through a sob. "I just clean up the lab after the students. But I was learning so much. I got to go to all their meetings, read all their papers."

"I'm glad," said Effingis. "I'm happy for you. I'm _proud_ of you. You weren't meant to be following me around taking notes for your whole life."

Breatsch T'Lin nodded, wiping her eyes and nose on her sleeve.

"Of course, I don't know if the lab is still there now. It wasn't in the part that collapsed. But it might have been repurposed. Or flooded."

"But the work remains," said Effingis. "They need you. We all need you."

--------

The Oversight Committee met to debate birthing new generations for the other ships at the same time as those for Vansage and K'Bel. Cryptum Effingis cast his vote in favour. The result was a tie.

-------

"I want to see Daracrin again," Effingis told T'Lin. "Do you know if it's possible?"

"It might be," she said, turning to a surface screen. "There are shuttles leaving from Outpost Four in a week or two. Oh but they're being decommissioned, actually, it'll be their last launch."

She paused.

"But you're not coming back, are you?"

Cryptum Effingis had realised it in the same moment T'Lin had.

Breatsch Araunga came by and Effingis had hiim made the arrangements for the journey to Outpost Four. Araunga and Breatsch Amba tussled over who would accompany the Cryptum to the launch site. Eventually they decided they would both go. Effingis took it as read that T'Lin would travel with them of course, and rolled his eyes across the room at her as the other two argued. He hardly needed an entire entourage.

Effingis occupied his time by reading compulsively about the Volt. As if he would find a clue about what happened to peoples' minds in there. It's not like anybody had ever come out to report back.

The Volt Fragments started to look to him like jagged voids, cut out from reality. A hole for consciousness to fall down.

But it's not lost, he told himself. It's never lost. It's accessible, then, for everyone, for ever more. He reassured himself by searching through the central database interface for information he knew had only been carried in the heads (or, perhaps, hearts) of friends from his youth. What Cryptum Lesjid Daracrin a-Uisir had eaten for breakast on the day of her partner's death, and why it mattered. Why Ancht Byallamora Daracrin a-Teprem had volunteered for the space walk which saved a thousand lives, and cost him his own. What Cryptum Elshwynn Daracrin an-Imtux had seen in him, in Cryptum Effingis Daracrin a-Teprem, in spite of everything. The kinds of things you only search for if you know to look. The kinds of things that are so deep in the Volt, so undiscoverable, that they might as well be lost. Effingis shuddered involuntarily. His friends were gone, all of them. Yet he could still find out their secrets. The things they never expected anyone to know, suddenly exposed. Or if not exposed, then vulnerable.

He closed the interface down. He was torn between whether this would be what they wanted, whether this was the immortality they had envisioned, or if he was violating their memories. What secrets of this world would Breatsch T'Lin be able to look up once he was gone?

* * *

"The journey will be hard on you," said Freilum Anmorth. "And the time on the station even more so. Are you sure about this? Be aware that you're going against my advice."

"Just give me what you can to get me there," said Effingis. "And let me worry about the rest."

Anmorth was loading him up with drugs to shield him from radiation sickness, to strengthen his lungs, to reduce dizziness. Anything he could think of. He was the only medical professional who would have dared. Cryptum Effingis thought himself lucky that Anmorth had been around when he had, and that he had chosen to stay on Newland Outpost Three a little longer.

He must have known that the treatments he provided were dangerous in the long term. Or even medium term. But he said: "they'll fix you up on the other end. In some ways the medical tech they have up their is better than what's down here. It's been tried and tested through so much. Just get yourself in a medipod as soon as you arrive. You'll be good to go."

Cryptum Effingis, Breatsch T'Lin, Breatsch Araunga and Breatsch Amba took a scooter to Newland Outpost Four. The scooters were almost fun; Effingis had never been in one before. It was like a minuture shuttlecraft, but low flying, squat and streamlined. The designs had been made centuries before, but none had been built until their arrival on the planet. They were good for short distances, and could just about maintain a height enought to shoot over the top of the jungle canopy. They buzzed like a fly, and Effinigs cranked open a window just a little to feel the warm air rushing in, until Amba had breathlessly insisted he close it.

At Newland Outpost Four they were met by two keen young assistants. Breatsch Allimby Elmneth a-Gracum welcomed them and talked at length about the facilities and amenities of the Outpost. Effingis was starting to wonder why, but his question was soon answered by Breatsch Malarin Elmneth an-Imtux, who finally interrupted to inform them, with an abrupt and completely unapologetic manner, that they were experiencing some delays with the launch.

They sat in a waiting room, choosing not to avail themselves of the facilities that had been described, except Effingis and Amba accepted some hot allura. The room had tall windows, was one storey above ground level, and looked out onto the launch pads where shuttles were being shunted around on wheeled platforms. Effingis was already starting to miss the jungle. The air was somehow even hotter, and there were no trees to be seen. Everything was coated in a layer of dust or grit, and the smells assaulted him. He couldn't figure out if they were pleasant or not - they were just so different. He remembered that the jungle had been like that when he had first arrived, but he must have got used to it. This place was different again.

The launch pads were in the middle of a broad metal expanse that had been built over the packed sand of the ground. Rails and wireless guidance systems and all kinds of technologies that engineers had been dreaming of and planning but never been able to implement on board the ships had finally been put into place. It had ended up being a bit of a hodge podge, some parts working better than others.

The delays kept coming. Some were to do with local equipment malfunctions. Apparently not unusual. Some were to do with the shuttles themselves, which were reaching the ends of their useful lives anyway. _It's a wonder we ever got anything in the air_, thought Effingis.

Breatsch Allimby and Breatsch Malarin were in and out, bringing updates or snacks or interesting facts about the desert. Eager to please, but not sure what to do. Araunga was content to chat their ears off, while Amba seemed preoccupied with her palm screen. T'Lin remained silent, staring out of the window at the dusty landscape. Effingis had no idea who was supposed to have been supervising them. He had the impression this was their first real assignment.

At long last, Breatsch Allimby came trotting down some stairs that apparently led to the place all of the information came from. Her smiles had been becoming increasingly forced, Effingis thought, over the past couple of hours, but the one she wore now seemed real enough.

"It's ready!" She gasped. Cryptum Effingis and the others stood up to meet her. "They've fixed your shuttle. Look, it's that one," she pointed out the window to one not too far away. "We can walk to it."

Cryptum Effingis's legs were stiff, and the metal ground outside looked like it was wobbling in the heat.

Breatsch Araunga frowned. "Isn't the ground hot, out there?"

"Oh, no! I can't believe I didn't mention it. It's a special material that turns the sunlight into energy. Everything around here is made from it. It's safe to walk on. It's very useful for a lot of things."

_Huh_, thought Effingis. _I hadn't realised they had produced so much of it. World is moving fast._

They took a few steps forward, and Effingis faltered. Breatsch Amba tapped Allimby on the shoulder.

"Please could you get the Cryptum something to walk with? A cane? It has been a long day."

Allimby scuttled away to comply, and returned within a few minutes with a walking frame.

Allimby left them at the door to the building, pointing out their shuttle in the distance.

"It looks further away now," Effingis grunted.

Breatsch Araunga walked alongside the Cryptum, looking tense, like he needed to be ready to catch Effingis if he fell. Breatsch Amba walked at Effingis's pace, half a step behind him, towards the shuttle. T'Lin brought up the rear. "Feel like an old man," he grunted.

Another figure was approaching to their left, someone tall, wearing a strange suit. The haze of the heat made it hard to see, but after a few more minutes Effingis realised it was a Nematan. It seemed to be heading straight for them.

They reached the shuttle at about the same time. It waited, a few paces back, for Effingis and his companions to board first. Somehow it seemed as uncertain of them as Effingis was of it.

It wore a dark, loose robe, covered in pockets, with a long pointed hood hanging down the back. Its skin was about the same colour as the robe, almost black, but with hints of something else. Greenish, perhaps. From a distance it looked like it had a headful of hair, but as it drew closer Effingis saw that they were some kind of wide, flat, pustules or skin flaps. It's features were delicate, a small nose and mouth, and leaf shaped eyes strangely like T'Lin's.

Effingis paused at the ramp, turning to say his goodbyes to his assistants. His final goodbye.

A buzzing, crackling voice came out of a speaker panel in the shuttle overhead. Effingis saw the Nemtan visibly jump in surprise.

"Uh hello again folks. I know you've been sitting around a lot already today and I've got some good news and some bad news." Cryptum Effingis rolled his eyes. "This is your pilot speaking, by the way, I'm Freilum Antisch K'Bel an-Imtux, pleasure to meet you. I'll meet you properly later no doubt. Well the bad news is this shuttle is going to have to wait a bit longer before going anywhere, our transport to take us to the launch site has broken down. The good news is, you get to enjoy the interior of the shuttle, which should be much more cool and pleasant and generally nice than the waiting room you've just been in. Load up. Anyone who is not launching with us today can get inside too, come take a look around. I'll let you know when it's time to leave, and you can disembark if you've changed your mind. We'll be doing a quick stop by _the moon_ en route, to drop off our guest."

Breatsch Araunga shrugged. "We might as well come in then. The pilot is right, it's probably nicer than waiting in the building." Amba was nodding vigorously, with a sideways look at the Nemtan.

All of them boarded.
